                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>A number of my posts have been about integrating different domains of knowledge in order to better understand how human behavior should be incorporated in the design of social software. I found <a href=../03/the_dunbar_numb.html>The Dunbar Number</a> in sociology, and both <a href=../04/four_kinds_of_p.html>Four Kinds of Privacy</a> and <a href=progressive_tru.html>Progressive Trust</a> come from my work in the cryptography field. The topic of this post comes from the field of architecture.</p>

<p>In order to provide for <a href=progressive_tru.html>Progressive Trust</a>, you need to establish what is known as an "Intimacy Gradient".</p>

<p>The concept of Intimacy Gradient comes from architect Christopher Alexander, in his book <a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. (Oxford University Press, 1977)</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn127.html>Pattern #127 - Intimacy Gradient:</a>

</i><p><i><b>Conflict:</b> Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence which corresponds to their degrees of privateness, the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family, will always be a little awkward.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i><b>Resolution:</b> Lay out the spaces of a building so that they create a sequence which begins with the entrance and the most public parts of the building, then leads into the slightly more private areas, and finally to the most private domains.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In architecture there are always some areas of the house or building that are more public -- the entry, the living room, the atrium, etc., and areas that are more private such as bathrooms, bedrooms, and offices. In a good design there is some marker of change between these different areas -- it might be a difference in ceiling height, a stairway leading to a different floor, or a narrow entrance. As an example, in the classical Japanese tea house, you have to bow low before entering.</p>

<p>Failure to respect the Intimacy Gradient results in uncomfortable buildings. <a href=http://munnecke.com/gehry.htm>Tom Munnecke</a> reported about a Frank Gehry building at Case Western Reserve University:</p>

<blockquote><p><i> I asked many of the graduate students how they felt about their new environment. "Horrible," said one. "Like living in a refrigerator" said another. "We used to have comfortable offices and gathering places, and had the most wonderful conversations. Now everything is so sterile, and the acoustics so bad, that we can't do anything together. I have to go outside if I want any privacy."</i></blockquote>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient is also used in other media. As I noted in my review of <a href=../01/seven_fingers_o.html>Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>When we arrived, we were led down the side of the theatre and all of a sudden I noticed that it looked like we were all being led backstage. We curve around and all of a sudden see an entrance -- maybe 5 foot tall requiring most of us to duck. We duck through and to our surprise, we are have walked through a fridgerator, and we are on the stage!

</i><p><i>One of the 7 players welcomes us, and another offers random people a glass of tea as we walk across the stage to our seats. The stage is set like a city loft, with a tv, some couches, a bed, a bathtub and shower, a kitchen, and of course the fridgerator we entered through. On the stage, and chatting to members of the audience are the 7 cast members, all wearing comfortable looking white shorts or athletic and white t-shirts.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i>The audience arrives over 30 minutes and the 7 players act as if we are guests of their loft, serving some of us tea, chatting, sweeping the floor, etc.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Entering through the refrigerator door raised the intimacy of the experience for the audience of that circus. Thus in spite of it being produced in a large auditorium it felt as up-close and personal as did the much smaller <a href=circus_contrapt.html>Circus Contraption</a>.</p>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient exists in movies as well -- anywhere you see a scene taking place in a public space that transitions down through smaller and tighter shots ultimately to a closeup of a face it is much more intimate then just cutting to the closeup.</p>

<p>In social software design, there also needs to be an Intimacy Gradient. One of the problems with Wikis is that there is often very little transition between public and intimate, and doing so can be quite jarring. SocialText, a Wiki service vendor, is aware of this problem and is <a href=http://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001393.html>"seeking to add more layers to the 'intimacy gradient', without recreating the highly structured collaboration tools that exist today"</a>. Ross Mayfield outlines <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/12/collaboration_cases_and_spaces.php>this possible future Intimacy Gradient for SocialText</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>
</i><ul><li><i>The broadest tier is a guest space, available to all</i></li><i>
<li>The second tier is a knowledgebase, accessible to all employees and contractors</li>
<li>The third tier is product development, for employees and contractors bound by a confidentiality agreement</li>
</i><li><i>The fourth tier is for the core management team to share confidential financial and HR information.</i></ul><p></blockquote>

<p>These thoughts from an earlier post by <a href="">Ross</a> are also thoughtful:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is right that groupthink is avoided by a social network structure that allows a dynamic and diverse periphery to provide new ideas, but the core of the network needs to be tightly bound to be able to take action. 

</i><p><i>That's the main point of Building Sustainable Communities through Network Building by <a href=http://www.orgnet.com>Valdis Krebs</a> and June Holley. When studying a <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/categories/socialNetworks/2003/01/07.html>community over time</a>, they suggest a vibrant community is made up of four stages: </i></p><i>

<ol><li>Scattered Clusters</li>
<li>Single Hub-and-Spoke</li>
<li>Multi-Hub Small-World Network</li>
<li>Core/Periphery</ol>

</i><p><i>The ideal core/periphery structure affords a densely linked core and a dynamic periphery. One pattern for social software that supports this is an <a href=http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P127.htm>intimacy gradient</a> (privacy/openness), to allow the core some privacy for backchannelling. But this requires ridiculously easy group forming, as the more hardened the space the more hard-nosed its occupants become.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>This is not just a problem for Wiki. There is an excellent paper on the web called <a href=http://www.ai.mit.edu/~konrad/docs/IJMMS-patterns-junestrand-keijer-tollmar.pdf>Design Patterns for Private and Public Digital Spaces in the Home Environment</a> where they explore how people used VNC (video-mediated communications, or more colloquially video-chat). They state:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The earlier "public" character of a traditional farmer's house or bourgeois flat (in Sweden) has disappeared with the modern housing planning. Instead, distinguishing the public from the private has become central during the industrial age, with the dwelling as an exclusively private place. Now, with the transition to an information society, it seems as if the concept of public space in the private dwelling has to be reconsidered, which also means that the borders between the private and the public at home have to be opened up.</i></blockquote>

<p>The need to provide for an Intimacy Gradient in social software is clear; however, the techniques for showing the transitions between the gradients are not. For instance, in the original Netscape Communicator, when you connected with a secure SSL connection, the border around the edge of the window would turn blue, and a solid blue key would show up. However, most people didn't notice this change and no current browser does this; even the little locked icon at the bottom of Internet Explorer and often isn't visible if you have the status bar turned off or if you are using frames.</p>

<p><a href=http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001289.htm>Flemming Funch</a> (and <a href=http://www.redtailcanyon.com/items/278391.aspx>mirror</a>) notes part of the difficulty is:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As long as a certain chat room or Wiki page is accessible directly with a deep link, it is going to be very hard to make it feel more intimate than any other place I can reach with similar ease. So a hierarchical structure of links doesn't do it. On the web you can't force people to accept your hierarchy if it is all just links.</i></blockquote>

<p>Part of the solution might come from the architecture world as well -- here are some other Patterns by Christopher Alexander (see the link for Alexander's resolutions for each):</p>

<ul><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn31.html>Pattern #31 - Promenade:</a> Each subculture needs a center for its public life: a place where you can go to see people, and to be seen.</li>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn61.html>Pattern #61 - Small Public Squares:</a> A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public rooms, that a town has. but when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn69.html>Pattern #69 - Public Outdoor Room:</a> There are very few spots along the streets of modern towns and neighborhoods where people can hang out, comfortably, for hours at a time.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn142.html>Pattern #42 - Sequence of Sitting Spaces:</a> Every corner of a building is a potential sitting space. But each sitting space has different needs for comfort and enclosure according to its position in the intimacy gradient.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn147.html>Pattern #147 - Communal Eating":</a> Without communal eating, no human group can hold together.</ul><p></p>

<p>Other lessons for social software from the architecture world are the concepts of "refuge and prospect", the "savanna theory", and "defensible space".</p>

<p><i>Refuge and prospect</i> come from the landscape architect <a href=http://www.landscaperesearch.org.uk/extra31/refuge.htm>Jay Appleton</a>. Prospect is a place where we can see others, and refuge is a place were we can retreat and conceal ourselves. A specific prediction of his theory is that people prefer the edges of a space more then the middle. Often prospect and refuge are in conflict, as a prospect tends to be expansive and bright whereas a refuge is small and dark, but there are cases where they are combined in one place; this is why we value private homes with a spectacular view so much, and why we pay so much to stay at <a href=http://www.djc.com/news/ae/11127729.html>scenic retreats</a>. So what are the edges of our social spaces? Are there ways that we can signal either prospect and refuge?</p>

<p>The <i>savanna theory</i> comes from a hypothesis by <a href=http://notes.utk.edu/bio/greenberg.nsf/0/f60081ef35fba95c85256e6e006a2a77?OpenDocument>Richard Coss and Gordon Orians</a> that we should be most comfortable with those landscapes where humans spent most of their evolutionary past. Thus supposedly the ideal landscape design has the same proportionality of trees, grass, and brush as the African savanna; parks and golf clubs are shown as evidence of this theory. An alternate to this theory is that we desire a certain amount of <a href=http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/institutes/urbanethology/student/html/erich/synekpro.html>visual complexity</a>. Either theory raises this question: what are the evolutionary markers regarding groups that our human ancestors needed? This question fits well with my thoughts regarding the <a href=../03/the_dunbar_numb.html>Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>defensible space</i> concept comes from the idea that anonymous spaces lead to problems because of vandalism, incivility, and crime, and to eliminate those problems requires the residents to mark their "territories" and "take possession" of their areas. We have similar problems in the online world. So maybe the answer is similar -- allow more ways for groups of people to mark up and take possession of their own virtual spaces.</p>

<p>There are a couple of links that integrate these ideas in architecture that you might find useful:<br>

<p>We are still breaking ground and exploring new ideas in the world of social software. However, there are already extant fields of study which may give us insight into this new venue. Architecture is one of them. By better understanding ideas of intimacy gradients, pattern language, refuge and prospect, savannas, and defensible spaces, we may gain new understandings of how to build social environments which are attractive and enjoyable to more people.</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I believe that as we evolve social software to better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in, we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work.</p>

<p>One useful concept I use I call "Progressive Trust". The basic idea is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, rather then solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust.</p>

<p>This is how I typically explain progressive trust when I meet someone in-person at a conference:</p>

<p>You are now spending your most precious resource, that most unrenewable commodity -- time, in order to listen and understand what I have to say.</p>

<p>Why do you do so? Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me--that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well. In turn, I'm willing to spend more time chatting with you for the same reason.</p>

<p>Why do we continue to chat, and not move on to other people to discuss with? Because as we chat we are exchanging a number of credentials -- people we know in common, common interests, meaningful ideas, etc. We may also present credentials typically issued by others, like our business cards, or explain our relationship to the host.</p>

<p>As our unspoken agreement to continue discussion evolves, we typically will unconsciously check to see if others are listening, and adapt our conversation thereafter. If the discussion becomes more personal or serious, we will often find ourselves moving to a more private portion of the room. As our discussions become deeper, we may begin to speak of things that hint at a mutual respect for confidentiality.</p>

<p>Also early on we'll begin to scope out the nature of our time together. Is it only professional, or a potential friendship? Even intimate relationships go through this phase -- are we with someone who wants to date? Is is possible that a future date lead to something more?</p>

<p>If we agree to meet later to discuss more, before we meet again we may go authenticate some of the credentials given us. We'll not authenticate all of them, only enough to substantiate the level of assurance that we need for the risk we are taking (which may only be the future loss due to wasted time, but even that is a form of risk.) This authentication can consist simply of confirming information given, or it can be as complex as asking for an endorsement from a mutual colleague.</p>

<p>As our collaboration grows, we will find ourselves seeking more and more credentials, endorsements, etc., but they will not be enough. The next level of trust can only be established by experience of commitment -- for instance do we call back when we said we would? These tests typically start with small things, and then grow to larger things. At some point this may ultimately grow to form simple verbal contracts; over time richer, deeper social contracts are agreed upon that might not be written down.</p>

<p>Ultimately we may bring in third parties to witness, and thus possibly enforce our mutual obligations, whether it is just having a mutual colleague view our handshake or friends see us kiss, or whether it is having a legal, signed document.</p>

<p>At some point our mutual interests may be so large that we decide not just to collaborate, but to share assets, whether through a partnership, a corporation, or a marriage. Before this is complete there will be more credentials and authentication of those credentials (talk to former employees, engage in credit checks, visit each others' families, take blood tests), endorsements, and less risky tests of the full contract (signing a term sheet, or a marriage engagement).</p>

<p>This is the way human trust works. It also very similar to the way that groups work -- a corporation will collaborate with another corporation in the same way, starting with small trust, going on to tests, and leading ultimately up to partnerships and mergers.</p>

<p>Computer trust rarely works the way that human trust does. It starts with mathematical proofs--that such and such a mathematical algorithm is extremely difficult, thus something built on it must also be difficult. These are then built on top of each other until a system is created. It often seeks a level of "perfect trust" that is rarely required by human trust.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I chose to back the then nascent SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Standard back in 1992-3, was that I felt that it much better mapped to the progressive trust model, and thus to human trust, then did its competitors.</p>

<p>At the time, the SET standard was backed by all the major players--Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft, etc. However, it not only required strong mutual authentication, but it also require multiple authentications. HTTPS was backed by RSA, required digital signatures, preferably by both parties. SSL was not necessarily a clear winner.</p>

<p>But SSL starts out very simple--first it just connects two parties, then it establishes simple confidentiality between them. If one party wants more confidentiality, they can upgrade to a stronger algorithm. Then one party can request a credential from the other, or both can. Either party has the option to request authentication of those credentials. Ultimately you could use SSL to come close to the level trust that SET tried to establish, but SSL isn't generally used that way because the market decided that only one party needed to send a credential--the merchant. SSL also proved to be more flexible then for use just with web pages or credit cards -- now it is used for things like securing email, creating VPNs, and playing online games.</p>

<p>Thus progressive trust is a useful conceptual model for understanding how trust might be built using online tools. Look at the tools that you are using now -- do they support various levels of trust, and a natural path between them? Or is trust more binary -- someone is only trusted, or not trusted. Are there implicit levels of progressive trust that are part of the culture of your group that might not embodied in the software itself?</p>

<p>Progressive trust also maps well to an user-interface design technique called <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProgressiveDisclosure>Progressive Disclosure</a>. It sequences information and actions across several different windows in order not overwhelm the user. You disclose basic information and choices first, then revealing progressively more complex information and choices. Thus you help the user manage the complexity of the application. Navigating group interactions and culture is also complex, thus progressive trust allows you to hide some of initial complexity of the trust model behind your tools, and thus lower barriers of entry to your software.</p>

                                <p>This is not a political blog, but like most bloggers I've been indundated with various discussions about the Bush Administration, Michael Moore, Red vs. Blue, etc. So much so that on some professional email lists we've had to ask the participants to use the text "[POLITICS]" in their subject lines so that we can filter out the overt political content.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I tend not to participate in the political discussions is because most often they are polarizing. They tend to preach to the already converted, to harden the line, and often are too polemic. This was my problem with Farenheight 411 -- I thought there was some good stuff in the movie, but it was in a format that I didn't think would persuade the uncommitted. The first time the director used innuendo to oversell his points, and when he showed a lack of any respect for other points of view I think he lost the uncommitted audience.</p>

<p>Thus in general I've been reluctantly participating in the current political dialogue. I have contributed to various causes and campaigns, and have spoken to my friends about my thoughts on the subject, but I've not been bringing that activity online.</p>

<p><a href=http://sociate.com/blog/archives/2004_07_01_archive.html#109113435166448725><img src=../../images/BushArtSm.jpg alt=BushArtSm height=175 style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" border=0 width=140></a>However, I really do admire this statement on a t-shirt by <a href=http://sociate.com/>Jerry Michalski</a> <i>"Apparently half of you believe George W. Bush is an adequate president. I don't agree, and would love to talk about it respectfully"</i>.  I like it because because it clearly states the respect that is needed regarding the issues that the other half believe in. You may not agree with those issues, but you will be respectful to the person that believes them. Jerry has made this t-shirt available at <a href=http://www.cafeshops.com/sociate.12621018>Cafe Press</a>.<a href=../../images/jont.html onclick="window.open('http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/jont.html','popup','width=304,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/jont-thumb.jpg alt=jont height=157 style="float: right; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" border=0 width=100></a></p>

<p>Not quite as respectful, but done with conviction is a song by UK artist <a href=http://www.waragainstsleep.com/>Jont</a> that I like called <a href=http://www.yi-tan.com/mp3s/Jont-WorldGoneBlind.mp3>World Gone Blind (MP3 format)</a>, and is freely distributable under a Creative Commons' Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivitives License. I first heard him play at one of Jerry's Retreats. The song is very hip and elegant.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>In my <a href=../01/seven_fingers_o.html>review</a> last January of the amazing <a href=http://www.les7doigtsdelamain.com/menu.html>Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a> I talk about why I like circuses that are more raw and intimate, i.e. more "human" then the pretentious and distancing style of <a href=http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/default.htm>Cirque du Soleil</a>. However, I was disappointed that I saw the near-to-last show, so could not send my friends out to go see one of the great performances of the year.</p>

<p>Last night at the recommendation of <a href=http://finnern.com/2004/07/31.html#a714>Mark Finnern</a> I went to see <a href=http://www.circuscontraption.com/>Circus Contraption</a>, a marvelous burlesque-style musical comedy circus at the very intimate setting of the <a href=http://www.cellspace.org/>CELLspace</a> warehouse in San Francisco's Mission district. I arrived early and was able to grab a couch up front to view from (ala the Red Vic or Parkway Speakeasy movie theatres). </p>

<p>This year's show is "Grand American Traveling Dime Museum" which is particularly appropriate theme given the re-opening this month of the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/01/PKGHI7U19K1.DTL">Musee Mechanique</a> on Fisherman's Wharf. The show plays at 9pm every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in August except for August 15th and August 29th, and is only $15!</p>

<p><a href=../../images/circus_contraption_1.html onclick="window.open('http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/circus_contraption_1.html','popup','width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/circus_contraption_1-thumb.jpg alt=circus_contraption_1 height=75 style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" border=0 width=100></a></p>

<p>The troupe consisted of twelve players, who performed almost two dozen acts (with an intermission in the middle) that ranged from clownwork, trapeze, ropework, tumbling, acrobatics, juggling, skits, stilts, puppets, etc., all set to music. What makes Circus Contraption truly unique is the risque nature of the acts, and the raunchy exuberance of the music numbers. With the Pickles Family Circus and Seven Fingers there is often a subtext of eroticism and sensuality, but as these are family shows these themes are not overt. Circus Contraption is quite overt and fun -- definitely rated R stuff.</p>

<p>I'd not put the athletic complexity of the circus acts up there with Seven Fingers or Cirque du Soleil, but that is also part of what makes them so fun. I particularly liked that most of the cast participated as musicians, clowns, and performers at different points of the show, giving a dynamism to the troupe -- you never knew who was going to do what. This also gave some authentic amateurism to the show ('amateur' meaning 'to love') that was delightful.</p>

<p>The musicianship of the troupe was superior (<a href=http://www.circuscontraption.com/audio/come2circus.mp3>sample</a>), and was up there with the great acts. I picked up a CD when I left and listened to it on the way home and it was a quality treat. The band is also playing on Monday's this month at "The Odeon" bar at 3223 Mission (at Valencia).</p>

<p>So if you are in the SF Bay Area this month, go run and get yourself a <a href=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/398>ticket</a>. I hope to go again on August 27th.</p>
