	<title>Comments on Politics with Respect</title>
	<subtitle>This is not a political blog, but like most bloggers I&#39;ve been indundated with various discussions about the Bush Administration, Michael Moore, Red vs. Blue, etc. So much so that on some professional email lists we&#39;ve had to ask the participants to use the text &quot;[POLITICS]&quot; in their subject lines so that we can filter out the overt political content. (post continues with more about why I don&#39;t participate much in political discussions, but then points people to a t-shirt statement and a song that I feel are respectful.)</subtitle>
