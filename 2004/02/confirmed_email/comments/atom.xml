			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/confirmed_email.html">&lt;p&gt;I discovered why I got &amp;#39;jailed&amp;#39; for a third time today. Two of us appear to have been jailed because of a bug when posting to groups. What happens is that if you write a long post, rather then the system tell you something is wrong, your posting form will just be refreshed. This will prompt you to submit a few more times, unsuccessfully. Then you realize it must be because your post is too long, so you&amp;#39;ll remove text a few times, and submit. At some point in this process, typically before you successfully trim it down enough to successfully post, you will discover you are in Orkut jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that makes us long-winded bloggers particularly vulnerable ;-)&lt;br /&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/confirmed_email.html">&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a pretty big &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; (or unpublished feature) indeed (!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, personally I try to keep my work email address off the net as much as possible, and have set pretty strict privacy settings on orkut, assuming they&amp;#39;d keep it private...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally (!!??) the amount of spam I&amp;#39;m receiving at my work email address has gone up vastly since joining Orkut... A very odd coincidence...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;However, this is incorrect, it will still send your email address in the &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Reply-To:&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time there is no way I know of to avoid this flaw if you are concerned about your email address other then changing it to a temporary one.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
