			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html">&lt;p&gt;Jakky, my personal opinion is that a SNS should *NEVER* send mass emails. Every relationship is precious, and each email from an SNS, whether an invite, a request, or a message, should be customized by the user for each recipient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this, I think Orkut and Friendster are borderline &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; because when you request a friend to join, you are not able to give a personal message. Worse practices are LinkedIn, Plaxo, and others that allow you to invite everyone in your address book at once without individual personalization. The absolute worst offenders are Zero Degree&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;one click no warning&amp;quot; invite of everyone, and Orkut&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Friends of Friends&amp;quot; messages. These last two I believe qualify as as being evil enough to call spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, at least a dozen of the errant emails that went out were blocked by spam filters. In particular it appears that you can&amp;#39;t send messages from Zero Degrees to anyone at Earthlink.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

You as a user initiated both emails but since you didn&amp;#39;t like the results if by a bug in zero degrees process and if by not expecting your friends reaction you call the very legitimate email &amp;quot;SPAM&amp;quot; a name reserved to Viagra and low mortgages handlers and by that de-legitimate the whole thing...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Great blog post explaining the mistake and don&amp;#39;t you just love tools like this that leave you feeling powerless and embarassed?  Sure makes me feel more confident in ZeroDegrees future success. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the explanation Chris!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
