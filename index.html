<div class="p-summary">Smarter Signatures: Experiments in Verifications By Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline A White Paper from Rebooting the Web of Trust II: The ID2020 Designshop Technologies like the Web of Trust and PKI lay the foundation for identity on the internet: they map a human persona to a cryptographic construct that is represented by a public key and protected by a private key. Digital signatures are fundamental to these digital identities and have been widely used in a variety of applications.</div>

<div class="p-summary">Today I head out to a month-long series of events associated with identity: I’m starting with the 22st (!) Internet Identity Workshop next week; then I’m speaking at the blockchain conference Consensus about identity; next I am part of the team putting together the first ID2020 Summit on Digital Identity at the United Nations; and finally I&#39;m hosting the second #RebootingWebOfTrust design workshop on decentralized identity. At all of these events I want to share a vision for how we can enhance the ability of digital identity to enable trust while preserving individual privacy.</div>

<div class="p-summary">As part of being a&#0160;member of the sustainable MBA community at Pinchot University, I have been trying to articulate what I like about the kinds of collaboration that are possible even inside a competitive industry. In our MBA program, we don&#39;t just teach about competitive strategy&#0160;(using classic&#39;s like Porter&#39;s book), but we also teach about the nature of&#0160;coopetition. These practices&#0160;are more&#0160;likely to lead to sustainable businesses (not only sustainable=green, but sustainable=enduring).</div>

<div class="p-summary">The traditional economic definition of “the commons” are those resources that are held in common and not privately owned. This is closely related to economic concept of public goods, which are goods that are both non-excludable (in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use) and non-rivalrous (where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others). My own personal definition for the commons is broader — any regenerative, self-organizing complex system that can be drawn upon for deep wealth.</div>
