                                <p>Regarding the Heartbleed bug, SSL and TLS vendors used to require code security reviews before CAs would accept certificate requests from that implementation.</p>
<p>My firm Consensus Development was the only one offering these reviews, largely because other security firms were scared of liability issues. Over 50% of the products failed in less then 8 hours of review, typically for very stupid mistakes. The CAs stopped asking us for reviews because it was slowing down sales of certificates.</p>
<p>I believe that we would have found last month's Apple bug if we reviewed it. Maybe not Heartbleed, but we were doing these security reviews TWENTY years ago. If we had kept at it we would have created better tools by now.</p>
<p>It may be time for CAs to require vendors to pay for implementation security reviews again, or only offer a lower level certificate. They also need to indemnify security reviewers so that they can do this kind of work without fear of being sued for not finding a bug (hard to prove a negative). And there should be a pool of funding to do independent security reviews of open source.</p>
<p>The amazing Tim Dierks , author of SSLRef, the reference implementation of SSL 3.0, co-author IETF TLS 1.0 standard and subsequent updates, and later creator of Google Wallet, did all of these reviews for us back then. Any memories, comments, or suggestion to add?</p>

As such, you should make sure that your online passwords are as strong as possible. This article will provide some general guidelines for doing so.</p>

<h3>Multiple Passwords</h3>

<p>Note that I said that you want to ensure your passwords, plural, are strong. That's because you'll want at least two. They should both be good passwords, but they should be used in different places.</p>

<p>Use a “non-secure” password for any non-financial websites that you sign up for, such as Facebook and Twitter. Use a different “secure” password for places where your credit card is on file or money changes hands, such as eBay, Amazon, your bank, and your stock broker. Because banks and other financial institutions are more likely to maintain good security over their transactions, reserving a password only for those sites makes it more likely that they will remain safe.</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be the tip of the iceberg. You might want to create a third password for shopping sites, or another one for less reliable sites that you might use. Ideally you would use a different password for every site. That would surely be the most secure, as someone breaking into one site couldn't get into your other accounts — but clearly that is too many passwords to remember. As a compromise, I'll talk shortly about an easy technique to both remember and vary your passwords.</p>

<h3>Criteria for Bad Passwords</h3>

<p>In a moment, I'm going to suggest an excellent method for creating a secure password. However, if you prefer to use your own methods, be sure to watch out for these common problems which could result weak passwords.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use obvious words. There was a time when “password” was one of the most common passwords on the internet (along with “root” and “”).
</li>
<li>Do not use words from the dictionary as passwords. Some of the oldest password crackers just dumped the entire dictionary at an account to see if any of them worked as passwords. This doesn't apply just to English either. It's easy enough for a password cracker to use any dictionary, whether it be French or Klingon.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on a dictionary word with simple substitutions. Though I'll talk in a bit about the advantage of substituting letters for numbers, a dictionary word with simple substitutions will be no more secure than just a dictionary word. That's because later password crackers would run not only the dictionary, but also a dictionary with a few substitutions, such as “0”s for “o”s and “1”s for “l”s.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on multiple dictionary words concatenated together. If you were concatenating three or four words, you might be OK, but password crackers were checking two word dictionary concatenations a decade ago.
</li>
<li>Do not use obvious names of people or places you know. Your girlfriend's name, your street address, and your favorite pet's name are all straight out. A password cracker may not be able to guess these (though testing against common names is another strategy used by some), but if someone who knows you can break in by hand, that's no good either.
</li>
<li>Do not write down your password, and especially do not write down your password in an online or computer file. If you picked the best password in the world, it doesn't matter if someone else can easily look at it.
</li>
<li>Do not keep the same password forever. It's pain, but you really should change it every year or two, at least, just in case someone has broken into one of your accounts, and you don't know it.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>A Method for Creating a Strong Password</h3>

<p>So you've learned a lot about what makes a bad password. What makes a good password? The following suggests one method that you can use to create a password that's not easily breakable — but which is easily memorable.
</p>

<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3952128651/ style="float: right;" title="Safari by ChristopherA, on Flickr" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank','scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img height=500 width=363 alt="Password Meter" title="Password Meter" src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3952128651_b6842a0ecf.jpg></a>

<ol>
<li>Pick a short phrase, or an obscure but memorable long word. For example “amber waves” or “perspicacious”.
</li>
<li>Shorten it to 7 characters, such as “ambrwvs” or “prspccus”.
</li>
<li>Convert a letter other then first to a number. You can use those obvious substitutions here (e.g., A=4, B=8, E=3, G=6, I=1, L=1, O=0, R=2, S=5, T=7), since they're not your only method of security. This might produce “ambrwv5” or “pr5pccus”.
</li>
<li>The next part is the key trick: use a specific letter from the domain name for the last character for your password and capitalize it. For example, you might add the third o from google, producing “ambrwv5O” or “pr5pccusO” for a GMail password. This ensures that even if
you use your password at multiple sites, anyone who steals the password can't use it another website unless they know the trick. You can also use this trick with your computer's password by choosing the third letter from the name you use for the computer, or for a password required for a software application, by using the third letter from the app's name.
</li>
<li>You should check the quality of your example password at <a href=http://www.passwordmeter.com/>Password Meter</a> -- “ambrwv5O” weight is 54%, which is pretty good for an 8-character password, “pr5pccusO” is 44%, which is OK, but both are significantly better because they will be different at every site.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The same technique can be used with longer words to create more secure financial passwords. These might be easier to remember if you use the first letters from a sentence or poem that you can remember to generate the initial phrase. For example, “My first pet's name was Arthur the Valiant Dog” would generate “MfpnwAtVD”. Again, you convert one or more letters to a number (“Mfpnw4tVD”). </p>

<p>When you add the domain letters to your secure password, you can strengthen it again by adding multiple letters, possibly to different parts of the password. For example, add the first and last letter the domain name. Thus a Google Gmail password might add a “G” to start and an “E” to the end, producing “GMfpnw4tVDE”. This one rates 70% at Password Meter, but again is actually better because of the site variation.<p>Also, most financial sites will accept, and some even require, passwords to include a symbol — I don't recommend this with your “non-secure” password as many ordinary sites do not allow symbols, but if you need one, then the following are some easy to remember substitutions: A=@, E=#, I=!, L=!, O=* S=$, or you can just put a symbol between the first domain letter and the passphrase (many sites will not allow a symbol at beginning or end). For example, password above could become “G$Mfpnw4tVDE” which raises this password's Password Meter rating to 90%.<p>With these two passwords you'll find it very easy to both remember and be secure against most password based attacks.</p>

<h3>A High-Tech Alternative</h3>

<p>An interesting high-security alternative that works best on webpages is to use <a href=http://supergenpass.com/>SuperGenPass Bookmarklet</a> — it takes the domain name plus a private master password and creates a unique high security password for each website based on a cryptographic hash of the two. It
can generate any length of password and you can't really get a password that is more secure, but there is the occasional web page that the bookmarklet doesn't work on. Fortunately, you can save <a href=http://supergenpass.com/mobile/>http://supergenpass.com/mobile/</a> as an .html file to your disk and you can open it anytime to manually create a supergenpass password for a website that you can copy and paste. I've even used SuperGenPass on my iPhone.</p>

<h3>Secondary Authentication</h3>

<p>Many sites require you to give them additional identification, such as mother's maiden name, the name of your pet, etc. Crackers have broken
into various celebrities accounts — such as Paris Hilton and Sarah Palin — by researching this information and asking for a password reset.</p>

<p>You can avoid this danger by treating these authentication requests like passwords. I have a standard word that I use for my mother's maiden name, my pet, etc. They're things that I can easily remember, but no one could figure out. Like the password technique above, I can easily add a letter from the domain. I've had no problem with customer service phone calls to banks; when they ask me for my mother's maiden name I just spell it out my encode word for them.</p>

<h3>Be Safe</h3>

<p>None of these approaches is perfect, but they significantly raise the bar against any but the most determined cracker from breaking into one
of your accounts. The domain letter technique will also make it very difficult for a cracker to break into your more important financial accounts if he gets access to your password from a poorly secured website or masquerades as a legitimate website or email by using a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing>phishing</a> attack.</p>

<p>However, don't ever think that a good password is the be-all and end-all of security. You also have to protect it adequately, and that doesn't just mean not writing it down, as mentioned above. You also must be alert to “social engineering”, where a cracker might call you or email you pretending to be associated with some institute where you might have an account.</p>

<p>Security is a constant game of oneupmanship between you and the black hats. Thus you need to ensure that you're always alert to the current best practices for setting, resetting, and protecting all of your security information on the internet.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I've been working on an ambitious list of topics that I'd like to cover over the next year. I offer them to you here so you can have some idea the areas that I am thinking about.</p>

<p><strong><em>Office Architecture for Innovation</em></strong> -- Over the years I've built or converted three offices to my specifications. From this I have learned a number of things about about how to create a productive environment innovation-oriented businesses. These include some of the obvious suggestions such as fresh air and natural light, but also include not so obvious ideas such as using magnetic paint and providing a small washer-dryer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Requisite Variety</em></strong> -- This concept from cybernetics applies to social systems as well. "The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate." More people, as well as a diversity of thinking styles and experience, give social software more "variety of actions", thus this is part of the reason why social software can be so effective.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Art and Craft of Meme Design</em></strong> -- We are learning more about how to create an effective meme. Creating memes has always been an art performed by publicists, marketers, politicians, the press, and to a lesser extent by scientists and other academics. Have we learned enough to turn this art into an explicit craft?</p>

<p><strong><em>Wiki Editing Dichotomy</em></strong> -- One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the "wiki editing dichotomy". You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don't know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.</p>

<p><strong><em>Choice &amp; Neuroeconomics</em></strong> -- There are some that say at the root of every decision is emotion. Even a 'rational' decision appeals to a sense of balance or beauty. Recent studies using PET are establishing a neurological basis for emotions, and some reveal interesting facts about how we make choices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Assessing Risk</em></strong> -- There are a variety of areas where we as humans have a difficult time being completely rational. One of these is risk assessment. It turns out we may be hard-wired to not be able toeasily understand risk that is greater then one in a hundred or so. Thus a very rare risk, say one in a thousand, will often be emotionally interpreted as having a much higher risk.</p>


<p><strong><em>Persuasive Computing</em></strong> -- BJ Fogg's group at Stanford has done some interesting research on how computers can persuade you to do something. There are a number of useful ideas that come from this research. There are also some ethical considerations that should be discussed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cognitive Dissonance</em></strong> -- This technique is central to many forms of persuasion intended to change beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors. It is used by facilitators, businesses, military organizations, and even cults. It can be used positively or negatively. How might it be used in social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>The Dark Side of the Force</em></strong> -- The same social tools that we use for good, can also be used for harm. How do we ethically use what we are learning about social software? Some say that almost by definition social software attracts spammers, trolls, and innappropriate sexuality. What can we do to prevent these misuses of social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Conversation vs Communication</em></strong> -- Update and rewrite of my <a href=http://www.alacritymanagement.com/GCnC.html>1990 essay</a> on how social software design needs to balance conversation vs communication.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Emotions</em></strong> -- We appear to have evolved a number of emotions that appear primarily to exist to support a common good, rather then to ensure our individual success. These include schadenfreude, mirth, naches, revenge, shame, pride, outrage, approbation, admiration, elevation, etc. Studies by Eckman on unconscious facial gestures, studies on the neurological basis for emotions, and studies on emotions in games, are proving that these social emotions exist. A number of them have interesting implications on social software.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glances &amp; Strokes</em></strong> -- There is some old work on the amount of eye contact we make with others in small groups, as well as some research from transactional analysis on strokes, which are the amount of recognition given to others through words and deeds. Is there a neurological basis for needing a certain number of glances and strokes each day? How does this concept apply to social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Weak Links</em></strong> -- There are some interesting social implications behind what we've learned about weak links in social networks. How do we identify and encourage weak links in our social software systems?</p>

<p><strong><em>Negativity vs Positivity</em></strong> -- It is far easier for someone to respond negativel than positively. In political systems it is far easier to say no rather then yes. What social software encourages positivity, and is it possible to design social software to do so?</p>

<p><strong><em>Time Economy</em></strong> -- Our ultimate most unrenewable resource is time. How time and attention are a basic economic unit that should be considered when looking at social software.</p>


<p><strong><em>Group Life Cycle</em></strong> -- We often focus on how groups form, emerge, and grow. Yet there are many lessons to be learned from how groups die, including that it isn't necessarily a bad thing and that keeping a group from death can be dysfunctional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Groupthink</em></strong> -- What causes groupthink? When is it good and when is it bad?</p>


<p><strong><em>Two Thresholds in the Value of Knowledge</em></strong> -- In order for knowledge to be valuable, it must at minimum be more valuable then the costs to find and absorb it (costs which include bandwidth and attention). Tools like Google have tremendously increased the amount of knowledge that is worth the time and attention to find it. What types of knowledge fall below this threshold of value? Is there a limit to how much we can lower this line? Furthermore, there is another threshold where the knowledge is significantly more valuable than only bandwidth and attention. How much have internet tools impacted this second threshold? Many internet business models, in particular content models, require some ability to offer value in this upper threshold -- can they survive as this upper threshold changes?</p>

<p><strong><em>Intimacy and Social Networks</em></strong> -- Social Networks Analysis tends to focus on the connections between people, either explicitly through acknowledgement of connections (LinkedIn, Friendster) or implicitly through analysis of your communication (Spoke). None are able to measure intimacy. Yet our intimate social networks are an important component of our overall happiness and contentment within both our professional and personal lives. How does intimacy work in social networks? Also there are some concepts in psychology known as communal vs exchange relationships by Clark &amp; Mills from late 70's that may apply here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Games</em></strong> -- A recap of Shannon Appelcline's and my analysis of the basic forms of social games types. These include relatively well understood ones like majority control, voting, meta-voting (Nomic), auctioning, etc., but also include less well understood games like playing of roles, dominance and submission, etc. There are also links to social emotions, such as mirth and schadenfraude.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Castle Marrach</em></strong> -- We released the Castle Marrach online game in September of 2000, and it was designed from the beginning to be a game for the Bartle-type known as "the socializer". What lessons did we learn in the five years since the release of the game? What tools are in my social software toolbox today that might have helped with the design?</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from F2F Facilitation</em></strong> -- There are many skilled practitioners of face-to-face facilitation, some of which are paid very high fees for their skills. What lessons can we learn from their experience that we can apply to social software? Why have so many of these facilitators failed to have success online?</p>

<p><strong><em>More Human vs More Than Human</em></strong> -- Many futurists seek to offer us augmentation of our minds and bodies through technology. Many of these ideas may fundamentally change what it is to be human, and may even have unforeseen complications unanticipated by their creators. One interesting approach to looking at these technologies is to examine which make us "more human", rather then "more than human".</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Mental Disorders</em></strong> -- Most, if not all, mental disorders have their roots in survival strategies; however, they are over-expressed because of genetic or other causes. Examining the healthy behaviors hiding behind depression, autism, mania, schizophrenia, paranoia, etc. offer a number of insights on how we think.</p>

<p><strong><em>Joy of being a Primate</em></strong> -- If you scan the surface of my writing, you may observe that I have a strong belief that our animal nature and genetics form an essential and often unconscious part of what it is to be human. You could interpret these "nature" over "nurture" ideas as limiting us to being just animals. Instead, I believe that by becoming aware of our primate nature, and choosing to leverage it or suppress it by conscious choice rather then letting it drive us unaware, is what makes us more powerful.</p>

<p><strong><em>Smart Contracts</em></strong> -- Nick Szabo popularized the idea of using some of the primitives of cryptography in unique ways to create what he calls "smart contracts". He hypothesized approaches to cryptographic handling of collateral, bonding, delineation of property, bearer certificates, and much more. Others have proposed various auction protocols using these concepts. One of the fundamental atomic elements of many of these smart contracts is something called a "reusable proof of work", which Hal Finney recently demoed a version of at CodeCon 2005. What are the possibilities offered by smart contracts? What are the barriers to implementation?</p>

<p><strong><em>Club System</em></strong> -- In the 80's, development of Ted Nelson's Xanadu vision was being financed by Autodesk. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons Xanadu failed to deliver any technology. However, a couple of their ideas could be valuable today, one of which is the concept of an alternative to the "user and groups" metaphor for computer security. Xanadu turned that idea upside down and called the result the "club system". The club system approach is particularly suited to the internet based collaboration tools, in particular wikis. I also have some insights to offer a cryptographic approach to the club system, which might allow P2P distribution of collaborative documents, while preserving group privileges.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edges of Cryptographic Security</em></strong> -- The SSL cryptographic protocol offers a choice of a number of security properties: integrity, confidentiality, encryption, one-party authentication, and two-party authentication. But there are a number of security properties that very few deployed cryptographic protocols offer. These include perfect forward secrecy, undeniability, deniability, authorization, delegation, multi-party authentication, shared secrets, etc. What are these security properties and how are they useful? Why have they not been successfully broadly deployed?</p>

<p><strong><em>The SSL Story</em></strong> -- When SSL was first proposed it was broken within an hour. Even when Netscape fixed those problems, it wasn't clear that SSL was going to win the battle of security protocols. SSL was competing against SHTTP which had backing of RSA and an industry consortium. The credit card companies merged their standards and were backing SET. The internet community was moving toward SSH. Microsoft was doing its own embrace and extend protocol PCT. So how did SSL win to become the broadest deployed cryptographic security protocol? The answers may surprise you.</p>

<p>I welcome any comments or suggestions for links on these topics, or any new topics that you feel are closely related.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>A number of my posts have been about integrating different domains of knowledge in order to better understand how human behavior should be incorporated in the design of social software. I found <a href=../../../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>The Dunbar Number</a> in sociology, and both <a href=../../../2004/04/four_kinds_of_p.html>Four Kinds of Privacy</a> and <a href=../../../2004/08/progressive_tru.html>Progressive Trust</a> come from my work in the cryptography field. The topic of this post comes from the field of architecture.</p>

<p>In order to provide for <a href=../../../2004/08/progressive_tru.html>Progressive Trust</a>, you need to establish what is known as an "Intimacy Gradient".</p>

<p>The concept of Intimacy Gradient comes from architect Christopher Alexander, in his book <a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. (Oxford University Press, 1977)</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn127.html>Pattern #127 - Intimacy Gradient:</a>

</i><p><i><b>Conflict:</b> Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence which corresponds to their degrees of privateness, the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family, will always be a little awkward.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i><b>Resolution:</b> Lay out the spaces of a building so that they create a sequence which begins with the entrance and the most public parts of the building, then leads into the slightly more private areas, and finally to the most private domains.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In architecture there are always some areas of the house or building that are more public -- the entry, the living room, the atrium, etc., and areas that are more private such as bathrooms, bedrooms, and offices. In a good design there is some marker of change between these different areas -- it might be a difference in ceiling height, a stairway leading to a different floor, or a narrow entrance. As an example, in the classical Japanese tea house, you have to bow low before entering.</p>

<p>Failure to respect the Intimacy Gradient results in uncomfortable buildings. <a href=http://munnecke.com/gehry.htm>Tom Munnecke</a> reported about a Frank Gehry building at Case Western Reserve University:</p>

<blockquote><p><i> I asked many of the graduate students how they felt about their new environment. "Horrible," said one. "Like living in a refrigerator" said another. "We used to have comfortable offices and gathering places, and had the most wonderful conversations. Now everything is so sterile, and the acoustics so bad, that we can't do anything together. I have to go outside if I want any privacy."</i></blockquote>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient is also used in other media. As I noted in my review of <a href=../../../2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html>Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>When we arrived, we were led down the side of the theatre and all of a sudden I noticed that it looked like we were all being led backstage. We curve around and all of a sudden see an entrance -- maybe 5 foot tall requiring most of us to duck. We duck through and to our surprise, we are have walked through a fridgerator, and we are on the stage!

</i><p><i>One of the 7 players welcomes us, and another offers random people a glass of tea as we walk across the stage to our seats. The stage is set like a city loft, with a tv, some couches, a bed, a bathtub and shower, a kitchen, and of course the fridgerator we entered through. On the stage, and chatting to members of the audience are the 7 cast members, all wearing comfortable looking white shorts or athletic and white t-shirts.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i>The audience arrives over 30 minutes and the 7 players act as if we are guests of their loft, serving some of us tea, chatting, sweeping the floor, etc.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Entering through the refrigerator door raised the intimacy of the experience for the audience of that circus. Thus in spite of it being produced in a large auditorium it felt as up-close and personal as did the much smaller <a href=../../../2004/08/circus_contrapt.html>Circus Contraption</a>.</p>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient exists in movies as well -- anywhere you see a scene taking place in a public space that transitions down through smaller and tighter shots ultimately to a closeup of a face it is much more intimate then just cutting to the closeup.</p>

<p>In social software design, there also needs to be an Intimacy Gradient. One of the problems with Wikis is that there is often very little transition between public and intimate, and doing so can be quite jarring. SocialText, a Wiki service vendor, is aware of this problem and is <a href=http://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001393.html>"seeking to add more layers to the 'intimacy gradient', without recreating the highly structured collaboration tools that exist today"</a>. Ross Mayfield outlines <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/12/collaboration_cases_and_spaces.php>this possible future Intimacy Gradient for SocialText</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>
</i><ul><li><i>The broadest tier is a guest space, available to all</i></li><i>
<li>The second tier is a knowledgebase, accessible to all employees and contractors</li>
<li>The third tier is product development, for employees and contractors bound by a confidentiality agreement</li>
<li>The fourth tier is for the core management team to share confidential financial and HR information.</i></ul><p></blockquote>

<p>These thoughts from an earlier post by <a href="">Ross</a> are also thoughtful:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is right that groupthink is avoided by a social network structure that allows a dynamic and diverse periphery to provide new ideas, but the core of the network needs to be tightly bound to be able to take action. 

</i><p><i>That's the main point of Building Sustainable Communities through Network Building by <a href=http://www.orgnet.com>Valdis Krebs</a> and June Holley. When studying a <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/categories/socialNetworks/2003/01/07.html>community over time</a>, they suggest a vibrant community is made up of four stages: </i></p><i>

<ol><li>Scattered Clusters</li>
<li>Single Hub-and-Spoke</li>
<li>Multi-Hub Small-World Network</li>
<li>Core/Periphery</ol>

</i><p><i>The ideal core/periphery structure affords a densely linked core and a dynamic periphery. One pattern for social software that supports this is an <a href=http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P127.htm>intimacy gradient</a> (privacy/openness), to allow the core some privacy for backchannelling. But this requires ridiculously easy group forming, as the more hardened the space the more hard-nosed its occupants become.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>This is not just a problem for Wiki. There is an excellent paper on the web called <a href=http://www.ai.mit.edu/~konrad/docs/IJMMS-patterns-junestrand-keijer-tollmar.pdf>Design Patterns for Private and Public Digital Spaces in the Home Environment</a> where they explore how people used VNC (video-mediated communications, or more colloquially video-chat). They state:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The earlier "public" character of a traditional farmer's house or bourgeois flat (in Sweden) has disappeared with the modern housing planning. Instead, distinguishing the public from the private has become central during the industrial age, with the dwelling as an exclusively private place. Now, with the transition to an information society, it seems as if the concept of public space in the private dwelling has to be reconsidered, which also means that the borders between the private and the public at home have to be opened up.</i></blockquote>

<p>The need to provide for an Intimacy Gradient in social software is clear; however, the techniques for showing the transitions between the gradients are not. For instance, in the original Netscape Communicator, when you connected with a secure SSL connection, the border around the edge of the window would turn blue, and a solid blue key would show up. However, most people didn't notice this change and no current browser does this; even the little locked icon at the bottom of Internet Explorer and often isn't visible if you have the status bar turned off or if you are using frames.</p>

<p><a href=http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001289.htm>Flemming Funch</a> (and <a href=http://www.redtailcanyon.com/items/278391.aspx>mirror</a>) notes part of the difficulty is:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As long as a certain chat room or Wiki page is accessible directly with a deep link, it is going to be very hard to make it feel more intimate than any other place I can reach with similar ease. So a hierarchical structure of links doesn't do it. On the web you can't force people to accept your hierarchy if it is all just links.</i></blockquote>

<p>Part of the solution might come from the architecture world as well -- here are some other Patterns by Christopher Alexander (see the link for Alexander's resolutions for each):</p>

<ul><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn31.html>Pattern #31 - Promenade:</a> Each subculture needs a center for its public life: a place where you can go to see people, and to be seen.</li>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn61.html>Pattern #61 - Small Public Squares:</a> A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public rooms, that a town has. but when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn69.html>Pattern #69 - Public Outdoor Room:</a> There are very few spots along the streets of modern towns and neighborhoods where people can hang out, comfortably, for hours at a time.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn142.html>Pattern #42 - Sequence of Sitting Spaces:</a> Every corner of a building is a potential sitting space. But each sitting space has different needs for comfort and enclosure according to its position in the intimacy gradient.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn147.html>Pattern #147 - Communal Eating":</a> Without communal eating, no human group can hold together.</ul><p></p>

<p>Other lessons for social software from the architecture world are the concepts of "refuge and prospect", the "savanna theory", and "defensible space".</p>

<p><i>Refuge and prospect</i> come from the landscape architect <a href=http://www.landscaperesearch.org.uk/extra31/refuge.htm>Jay Appleton</a>. Prospect is a place where we can see others, and refuge is a place were we can retreat and conceal ourselves. A specific prediction of his theory is that people prefer the edges of a space more then the middle. Often prospect and refuge are in conflict, as a prospect tends to be expansive and bright whereas a refuge is small and dark, but there are cases where they are combined in one place; this is why we value private homes with a spectacular view so much, and why we pay so much to stay at <a href=http://www.djc.com/news/ae/11127729.html>scenic retreats</a>. So what are the edges of our social spaces? Are there ways that we can signal either prospect and refuge?</p>

<p>The <i>savanna theory</i> comes from a hypothesis by <a href=http://notes.utk.edu/bio/greenberg.nsf/0/f60081ef35fba95c85256e6e006a2a77?OpenDocument>Richard Coss and Gordon Orians</a> that we should be most comfortable with those landscapes where humans spent most of their evolutionary past. Thus supposedly the ideal landscape design has the same proportionality of trees, grass, and brush as the African savanna; parks and golf clubs are shown as evidence of this theory. An alternate to this theory is that we desire a certain amount of <a href=http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/institutes/urbanethology/student/html/erich/synekpro.html>visual complexity</a>. Either theory raises this question: what are the evolutionary markers regarding groups that our human ancestors needed? This question fits well with my thoughts regarding the <a href=../../../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>defensible space</i> concept comes from the idea that anonymous spaces lead to problems because of vandalism, incivility, and crime, and to eliminate those problems requires the residents to mark their "territories" and "take possession" of their areas. We have similar problems in the online world. So maybe the answer is similar -- allow more ways for groups of people to mark up and take possession of their own virtual spaces.</p>

<p>There are a couple of links that integrate these ideas in architecture that you might find useful:<br>

<p>We are still breaking ground and exploring new ideas in the world of social software. However, there are already extant fields of study which may give us insight into this new venue. Architecture is one of them. By better understanding ideas of intimacy gradients, pattern language, refuge and prospect, savannas, and defensible spaces, we may gain new understandings of how to build social environments which are attractive and enjoyable to more people.</p>

					<h3 class=entry-header><a href=../../../2004/08/progressive_tru.html>Progressive Trust</a></h3>
		



		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I believe that as we evolve social software to better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in, we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work.</p>

<p>One useful concept I use I call "Progressive Trust". The basic idea is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, rather then solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust.</p>

<p>This is how I typically explain progressive trust when I meet someone in-person at a conference:</p>

<p>You are now spending your most precious resource, that most unrenewable commodity -- time, in order to listen and understand what I have to say.</p>

<p>Why do you do so? Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me--that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well. In turn, I'm willing to spend more time chatting with you for the same reason.</p>

<p>Why do we continue to chat, and not move on to other people to discuss with? Because as we chat we are exchanging a number of credentials -- people we know in common, common interests, meaningful ideas, etc. We may also present credentials typically issued by others, like our business cards, or explain our relationship to the host.</p>

<p>As our unspoken agreement to continue discussion evolves, we typically will unconsciously check to see if others are listening, and adapt our conversation thereafter. If the discussion becomes more personal or serious, we will often find ourselves moving to a more private portion of the room. As our discussions become deeper, we may begin to speak of things that hint at a mutual respect for confidentiality.</p>

<p>Also early on we'll begin to scope out the nature of our time together. Is it only professional, or a potential friendship? Even intimate relationships go through this phase -- are we with someone who wants to date? Is is possible that a future date lead to something more?</p>

<p>If we agree to meet later to discuss more, before we meet again we may go authenticate some of the credentials given us. We'll not authenticate all of them, only enough to substantiate the level of assurance that we need for the risk we are taking (which may only be the future loss due to wasted time, but even that is a form of risk.) This authentication can consist simply of confirming information given, or it can be as complex as asking for an endorsement from a mutual colleague.</p>

<p>As our collaboration grows, we will find ourselves seeking more and more credentials, endorsements, etc., but they will not be enough. The next level of trust can only be established by experience of commitment -- for instance do we call back when we said we would? These tests typically start with small things, and then grow to larger things. At some point this may ultimately grow to form simple verbal contracts; over time richer, deeper social contracts are agreed upon that might not be written down.</p>

<p>Ultimately we may bring in third parties to witness, and thus possibly enforce our mutual obligations, whether it is just having a mutual colleague view our handshake or friends see us kiss, or whether it is having a legal, signed document.</p>

<p>At some point our mutual interests may be so large that we decide not just to collaborate, but to share assets, whether through a partnership, a corporation, or a marriage. Before this is complete there will be more credentials and authentication of those credentials (talk to former employees, engage in credit checks, visit each others' families, take blood tests), endorsements, and less risky tests of the full contract (signing a term sheet, or a marriage engagement).</p>

<p>This is the way human trust works. It also very similar to the way that groups work -- a corporation will collaborate with another corporation in the same way, starting with small trust, going on to tests, and leading ultimately up to partnerships and mergers.</p>

<p>Computer trust rarely works the way that human trust does. It starts with mathematical proofs--that such and such a mathematical algorithm is extremely difficult, thus something built on it must also be difficult. These are then built on top of each other until a system is created. It often seeks a level of "perfect trust" that is rarely required by human trust.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I chose to back the then nascent SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Standard back in 1992-3, was that I felt that it much better mapped to the progressive trust model, and thus to human trust, then did its competitors.</p>

<p>At the time, the SET standard was backed by all the major players--Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft, etc. However, it not only required strong mutual authentication, but it also require multiple authentications. HTTPS was backed by RSA, required digital signatures, preferably by both parties. SSL was not necessarily a clear winner.</p>

<p>But SSL starts out very simple--first it just connects two parties, then it establishes simple confidentiality between them. If one party wants more confidentiality, they can upgrade to a stronger algorithm. Then one party can request a credential from the other, or both can. Either party has the option to request authentication of those credentials. Ultimately you could use SSL to come close to the level trust that SET tried to establish, but SSL isn't generally used that way because the market decided that only one party needed to send a credential--the merchant. SSL also proved to be more flexible then for use just with web pages or credit cards -- now it is used for things like securing email, creating VPNs, and playing online games.</p>

<p>Thus progressive trust is a useful conceptual model for understanding how trust might be built using online tools. Look at the tools that you are using now -- do they support various levels of trust, and a natural path between them? Or is trust more binary -- someone is only trusted, or not trusted. Are there implicit levels of progressive trust that are part of the culture of your group that might not embodied in the software itself?</p>

<p>Progressive trust also maps well to an user-interface design technique called <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProgressiveDisclosure>Progressive Disclosure</a>. It sequences information and actions across several different windows in order not overwhelm the user. You disclose basic information and choices first, then revealing progressively more complex information and choices. Thus you help the user manage the complexity of the application. Navigating group interactions and culture is also complex, thus progressive trust allows you to hide some of initial complexity of the trust model behind your tools, and thus lower barriers of entry to your software.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I spent most of last week at the RSA Conference in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Like last year, I found little that excited me. I overheard from a convention staffer that they had 30% more attendees, so the conference is growing again, but my week there also reinforced my opinions regarding the industry as a whole as I describe in my previous blog posting <a href=../../../2004/02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a>.</p>

<p>I asked a number of random people what they thought of the conference. Some agreed with me, saying that they were troubled by the lack of innovation. Others said that they actually liked it -- it showed that the industry was being run by businessmen finally, and not by geeks. Others said that it was just the inevitable maturation of an industry. Tim Oren wrote in his blog <a href=http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2004/02/27.html#a565>Due Diligence</a>:<blockquote>Every year the show is less about cryptography per se. I'm sure this has something to do with RSA's attempts to diversify as its patents expire, but I do think it reflects the state of the field. Crypto has become a standardized component of security solutions, and the biggest perceived threats are not in the privacy area.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The hilight of the conference to me was hearing respected cryptographer Whitfield Diffie say to me that he had read my <a href=../../../2004/02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a> and that he liked it. Apparently it had been sent to him by someone at Sun who had thought that it was saying many of the things that Diffie has been saying as well. Diffie said that he had some specific criticisms, so I hope that he'll comment here someday on them.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Caller-ID for Email</h4><p></p>

<p>The big announcement of the week was that Microsoft will be be releasing their own spam solution, a <a href=http://windows-help.net/cgi-bin/2004/7.08.cgi?70801>Caller ID</a> for email addresses, starting this summer in HotMail and in their mail servers. Basically the way this works is that every domain holder publishes inside their DNS records the IP addresses of any valid outbound email server. This information is stored using XML in a special signed format. After a mail is sent, the receiving system queries the DNS to confirm that the outbound server is not being spoofed.</p>

<p>This is a very similar technique to what a number of other companies are proposing, for instance AOL is backing a proposal called <a href=http://spf.pobox.com/execsumm.html>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> or sometimes "Sender Permitted From", and Yahoo is backing <a href=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1430976,00.asp>Domain Keys</a>. Unfortunately, Microsoft's Caller-ID proposal requires XML, which makes implementation much more complicated. It requires the entire email to be received by the server first, before looking up the DNS record, then validating a signature -- all of which introduces more burdens on the mail server. Lastly, this XML may exceed the 512-character limit for DNS requests, which can cause DNS servers to send via TCP rather then UDP, which may introduces even more uncertainty.</p>

<p>It is good to see that Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo are taking spam seriously, but I do worry that that the burden of supporting more then one of these standards may be significant. This could mean that only large corporations, educational institutions, and ISPs could host email, whereas small companies, third-world organizations, and individuals could not. I would prefer that one solution be broadly and easily adopted. <font color=red><s>Daniel Goldman</s></font> <font color=green>Yakov Shafranovich</font> in <a href=http://www.shaftek.org/blog/archives/000061.html>NetWizard's blog</a> is also concerned about patent claims and lack of IETF participation:<blockquote>At the same time none of these proposals have been submitted to any standards bodies such as the <a href=http://www.ietf.org>IETF</a>, and as a matter of fact <a href=https://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/asrg/current/msg09082.html>Microsoft was invited</a> to submit "Caller ID" and participate in <a href=http://www.ietf.org/ietf/04mar/marid.txt>this week's meeting at the IETF on the subject</a>, but <a href=http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg00023.html>they declined</a>. At the same time the community had jumped on Caller ID's patent license by declaring a (and <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/02/26/1448253&amp;mode=thread">a possible incompatibility with the GPL</a>). Of course it remains to be seen what exactly does Caller ID claim to patent since RMX and other prior art existed at least since 1998, and if Caller ID ever makes it to the IETF, Microsoft will have to deal with <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3669.txt>the new IPR guidelines (RFC 3669)</a> which favor non-patented technologies.</blockquote>I'm also not convinced that even if these techniques are deployed (Gartner group <a href=http://informationweek.securitypipeline.com/news/18201583>predicts</a> less then 25% will implement these in the next two years) that they will not return us to early 1990's levels of spam, only just slow down the onslaught. For instance, in a similar fashion to current WiFi war-chalking, a spammer could wait until an authenticated user logged in a mail server and hijack that connection. Unless the link is encrypted and authenticated, it is possible for a spammer to impersonate the legitimate user without anyone being the wiser. Related, these techniques do not necessarily help with the growing threat of "phishing" -- emails that lure unsuspecting users to enter credit card or bank account information into fake web sites.<p></p>

<p>I am also concerned that all of these standards require some measure of public-key infrastructure, including management of public-keys, which many security analysts believe that we are not doing a good enough job now.</p>

<p>There is some good thoughtful analysis of these three standards by Larry Seltzer of eWeek in <a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,1761,a=120536,00.asp">Who will Win the SMTP Authentication Wars</a>.</p>

<h4>More Security in Windows XP SP2</h4><p></p>

<p>Bill Gates also discussed new security features in the upcoming Windows XP SP2. In addition to some interesting "Active Protection Technology" to prevent overflow attacks, he discussed built-in virus protection and an improved built-in firewall that also warns of outbound connections.</p>

<p>Out in the hall I heard some people saying that announcement was a good basis for selling Symantec short, while others countered that Microsoft never gets these type of things right and there would always be business for Symantec. Companies that offer more minor features like preventing browser popups will be hurt. However, as these solutions are already free and ubiquitous, this is one of the few cases where I prefer for these to be in the default Microsoft install. However, I do worry for the smaller but more innovative security vendors like ZoneAlarm.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Sessions</h4><p></p>

<p>Over the years the sessions at RSA have become more managerial and corporate in nature, but there were a couple of good technical sessions that I attended or friends commented on.</p>

<p>I was pleased by the Cryptographer's Panel response to Bill Gates' announcements: "We have a lot of great levers in cryptography, but we're missing the OSes and platforms that can really serve our keys," said Ronald Rivest. "Bill Gates didn't talk about simplifying things, but that's the only way we are going to get security. We're not smart enough to handle the complexity of this stuff. You have to get the complexity out of there," continued Paul Kocher. Whitfield Diffie criticized security the upcoming Windows Longhorn release because "For the first time, you will have a PC that does NOT do what you tell it to." </p>

<p>The Cryptographer's Panel also spoke on the topic of electronic voting, and supported calls for paper ballots to supplement and verify votes cast with new electronic voting technology. Rivest cautioned "We know only too well the difficulties of securing complex electronic systems."</p>

<p>I also heard good things about the "Hacking VM Machines" and "Analyzing Topologies of Trust" sessions, and the closing keynote by PJ O'Rouke, but I missed them -- anyone have any notes? Where there some other good sessions I missed?</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Exhibits</h4><p></p>

<p>The exhibit floor was again a bit droll for me.  Like in previous years the floor was dominated by vendors selling rather high-end corporate systems that might have excited me more if I was in the market for one, but I was looking for less expensive systems for smaller businesses. Like last year there were lots of dedicated devices, such as firewalls, spam prevention, VPN and intrusion detection hardware, and fewer companies offering software to use with my existing hardware.</p>

<p>I did like some of the biometric hard drives, but investigating more deeply I just can't trust them yet. No one yet offers a good solution for redundant key storage yet for these, as a backup in case of a physical failure.</p>

<p>I did see one company <a href=http://www.authenex.com>Authenex</a> that was offering free USB keys that supposedly allow you to encrypt files on your system and email them to someone else with a different key -- it looks like some public key technique is being used, with the key serving as a pre-generated private key storage. More interestingly, they claim that if you register your USB key at their website, they can send you a replacement key that you can use to decrypt your old files. I'll have to do some more investigation of the technology behind this, and if they've had adequate study by cryptographers that I trust. If they have, and they start offering storage on those keys as well, they may have something useful that I'll buy.</p>

<p>RSA had an demo of it's <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/company/news/releases/pr.asp?doc_id=3376">prototype RFID blocker tag</a> that they suggest is a possible solution to some of the fears that some of us privacy advocates have been worrying about. <a href=http://scottmace.typepad.com/imanager/2004/02/cool_demo_rsa_r.html>Scott Mace</a> has a good description of the demo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each booth visitor selects from one of three demo prescriptions -- "tranquility pills," "wisdom pills," or "happiness pills." (I chose wisdom, naturally.) The RSA Labs crew requests a name from the visitor, then hands over an appropriately-tagged bottle (mine contained jellybeans). They scan the bottle on an RFID tabletop scanner and visitors see the details of the prescription, including type of prescription and patient's name. Then, they insert the bottle into an ordinary paper pharmacy bag that happens to contain a paper "blocker tag" that then blocks any attempt for an RFID reader to scan the bottle while it's in the bag.</blockquote><p>
Though a cool demo, I'm not as confident that this solution will work. Now in addition to the previous "foil bag" theft techniques, what prevents someone from building one of these into a watch or a PDA? Sending a signal to burn-out the RFID is one of the other proposals out there, it has similar problems -- what if someone goes into a WalMart and burns-out every RFID in the place?

<p>RSA was also demoing its latest SecurID integration with Windows, which will extend the life of this security token for RSA customers for many years. I spoke to Scott Schnell, VP of Marketing, afterwards at a party and he explained to me some of the details of how they made it work with Windows laptops. Apparently the system will cache up to several weeks worth of SecurID information such that the laptop owner can use his SecurID token to log on to his laptop even though he is not connected to the network. I neat trick, though I'd like to see some more security reviews before I'd deploy it broadly.</p>

<p>Probably the most interesting, but least useful to me, was a booth for <a href=http://www.magiqtech.com/>Magiq Technology</a>, who offer a commercial quantum cryptography solution. Quantum cryptography is the ultimate in secret key exchange at a distance -- you can sort of say that the universe protects you from snoopers. However, you have to have a fiber-optic connection between the two devices, which limits its practicality. But it is still cool.</p>
