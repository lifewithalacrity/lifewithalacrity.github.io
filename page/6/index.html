<div class="p-summary abstract">Like many others, I've been paying attention to Orkut in the last couple of weeks. I've answered more requests to be &quot;friends&quot; on Orkut then I have of any of the other half-dozen Social Networking Services I've tried, and I've looking at other people's friends to see if I know anyone. I've yet to ask someone to join Orkut that wasn't already a member, and I've been careful to not have anyone as a &quot;friend&quot; that I didn't know reasonably well and I thought knew me.</div>

Oddly, the number of friends I have in each of these is less the older they are. In Ryze I have 36, and in Tribe.</div>

I decided to go because 2 of the 7 members have a history with the Bay Area "Pickle's Family Circus" which was a fabulous intimate circus that disbanded about 10 years ago. I loved the Pickles Family Circus because it was "human" -- I found Cirque de Soleil to be too cold and almost unhuman.</div>

Social Gaming Interactions, Part One: A History of Form
The first article outlines the problem by looking out how social interaction has traditionally been handled in online games, and by considering how limiting these interactions typically have been. It also outlines how to expand traditional social interactions by describing three main categories of social interaction: competition, cooperation, and freeform.</div>

At this point its oldest game Castle Marrach is completely run by the players, and 7 more games are being developed by their customers. The company is at break-even, but is not yet a 'commercial success'. There are some learnings from the world of massively multiplayer online games that apply to other kinds of social networks.</div>
