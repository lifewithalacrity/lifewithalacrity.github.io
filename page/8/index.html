				<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ryzeblogtribefriends.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=579,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/ryzeblogtribefriends.gif alt=Ryzeblogtribefriends height=181 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Ryzeblogtribefriends></a></p>

<p>As someone who now has over 171 professional "connections" in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn Profile</a>, 198 "friends" on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a>, many more non-intersecting friends and acquaintances on   <a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.Net</a>, <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/christophera_/>LiveJournal</a>, and <a href=http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/sns-meta-list/>other social networking services</a>, as well as a plethora of correspondents that I only interact with via email, I am trying reconcile a mismatch between my connections and my own <a href=../../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?</p>

<p>Venture Capitalist <a href=http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/02/quality_or_quan.html>Jeff Nolan</a> relates similar concerns:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
"It strikes me that the social networking theory holds that the more volume you have, the bigger your network will become by introducing degrees of separation roughly along the lines of Metcalfe's Law. I disagree, human networks do not grow in value by multiplying, but rather by reduction. For me, it's the quality of relationships that enhances my professional and personal life, not the sheer numbers."
</em></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately social networking services -- be it LinkedIn, Tribe.Net, Orkut, or LiveJournal -- are making the problem worse, not solving it. Any engineer or information theorist can tell you that a system that only has amplifiers will be out of balance, and that you need attenuators in the system as well. Our current breed of social networking services have focused on amplifying our contacts not only because it serves us, but because it serves them. The more contacts that you make, the more people they potentially have in their service. However, in the long run this is unsustainable -- a social networking service also has to be useful -- merely amplifying your contacts isn't enough.</p>

<p>Thus the problem becomes not just one unique to me, where my friends network is overextended, but rather one that's endemic to the current generation of social networking services. In order to solve it we need to look at the traditional cultural answers to the problem, compare them to technical solutions, both current and to-be-invented, and then see how a new generation of social networking services can be designed that molds the two ideas together into a more cohesive whole.</p>

<p>I offer here the beginning of that discussion.</p>

<h4>The Cultural Strategies</h4>

<p>The problem of overextended social networks are not new with the Internet generation. Many professions require maintaining a large base of relationships and have done so for hundreds of years, among them: politicians, salespeople, public company CEOs, and even professions that you might not think of requiring these skills such as family doctors. The Dunbar Number of 150 may be a kind of species-wide average limit, it is not an individual limit -- thus my guess is that people with an innate talent for maintaining more relationships are attracted to these professions. But even with innate talent those who follow these professions can be overwhelmed, and each have found different cultural strategies for managing larger numbers of relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Spending More Time:</strong> Some people just spend a lot more time keeping up with their connections. Politicians and salespeople are classic examples of professions that require significant schmoozing time in order to keep trusted connections together.</p>

<p>How does someone like a member of the US House of Representatives manage their relationships? In no way can they even come close to having a relationship with all the 645,952 people they represent. They would, however, at least have to keep up at some level with the other 435 House members, their own staff, key members of the staff of other House members, as well as key politicians and contacts back home. From what I've read, successful politicians spend most of their days just meeting with people, and have staff dedicated to "tickling" -- keeping track of constituents, schedules, issues, etc. and reminding the politician before each meeting of the essentials they need to know.</p>

<p>The cost of this strategy is twofold -- the time spent managing relationships can't be spent elsewhere, and the quantity of relationships lowers the quality of those relationships. For instance, my experience with most politicians and many salesperson is that I will be forgotten as soon as I leave the room.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Changing the Standard:</strong> There are different cultural standards in each profession as to what is an acceptable relationship. Thus some people chooose a profession that manages relationships in different ways. Doctors are a good example of socializers who fit into this category.</p>

<p>Your family doctor has a similar problem to that of politicians -- too many people to keep track of. Yet a good family practitioner can see you and look beyond just today's symptoms. Thus because of an ongoing relationship with you he can be a better doctor.</p>

<p>The way the doctor does this is through cultural and professional limits. Because of the authority, status and title granted to doctors, patients tend to defer to them. There is not an expectation that the relationship is equal. This allows the doctor to have a 'shallower' relationship with the patient that is still acceptable.</p>

<p>Still, even this level of serial, shallow socialization can be excessive for many people. A Radiologist acquaintance of mine told me the reason why she ended up in her specialty was that she just couldn't handle the ongoing patient relationships required by other specialities -- instead, she now looks at one set of images at a time, performs a diagnosis, and doesn't have to retain any relationship to move on to the next patient.</p>

<p>There are also problems with changing your socialization standards. Unless it is culturally understood, or your standard is reciprocated by others, it can make you appear shallow and not trustworthy. I've seen this when someone moves from one profession to another, say a salesperson to a manager -- styles of relationships that were acceptable among salesperson and between salespeople and customers are not quite as acceptable as those between managers and their staff. Another example is when someone moves from the East Coast to the West Coast, where the usefulness of casual alumni connections is significantly less valued, but those casual connections are unable to understand the change in standards.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Prioritization:</strong> Perhaps a more common cultural strategy for managing excessive relationships is prioritization. I could prioritize my relationships and focus only on the 100+ or so that might be the most useful to me.</p>

<p>There are two problems with prioritizing. First, analyses of social networks show that it is often the weak and most unrelated links that can be <a href=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1333462/0>the most important</a>. Thus any attempt to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage>triage</a> may cut off some of these weak ties because I thought that the links might not be "useful".</p>

<p>Secondly, how do you tell someone "I'm sorry, but I'm overly Dunbarred, so I have removed you from my list." Rejection is painful (as <a href=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/mripain01.htm>MRI brain studies</a> have actually shown), so I risk offending people forever by excluding them today.</p>

<h4>The Technological Solutions</h4>

<p>One of the great hopes of social networking services is to improve the ways that we interact with other people, particularly those that we know at a distance -- the "weak links". Right now, these services are part of the problem because they offer out-of-balance social systems. However, they can also be part of the solution; science-fiction writers and social software designers alike are starting to look at these issues and offer new solutions that would not have been possible before the advent of widespread software communication systems.</p>

<p><strong>Technological Solution - Augmentation:</strong> <img border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/geodesica.jpg style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title=Geodesica alt=Geodesica>I recently read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a>, a new science fiction novel by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, a futurist example of augmentation as a method of maintaining extended social networks.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a> the protagonist, "Melilah" is a politician in the distant future. She has her own problems with the Dunbar Number, and solves it with her own personalized social networking service:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Two things she had learned from her political career were that society depended on interpersonal relationship networks, and that everything could turn on a simple misidentification. In her fifties she had set about ensuring that her memory remained in good working order in order to avoid the latter. Anthropologists had known since the twentieth century that people were born with a ceiling on their social groups. Once Melilah exceeded the Dunbar and Hill number of 150, and rapidly acquiring still more associates, it became progressively harder to keep track of everyone she had to know. As she passed her hundredth birthday, it became only worse. Some of her contemporaries option for cortical grafts and other memory prosthetics. She, motivated by a gut-level -- some would say irrational -- desire to keep her body as free of technology as possible, opted for other means.</em></p>

<p><em>She had found that using a name once every two months was enough to keep her memory fresh. Any longer than that between reminders, and the associations faded, rendering recall unreliable. So she programmed a complete list of her occasional acquaintances and enemies into a database and programmed it to cycle through them ever sixty days, shuffling the order each time.</em></p>

<p><em>A hundred years on, she was still in the habit of skimming fifty or so names a day, just to keep on the ball. By flicking through the images, voice files, place names, and more obtuse clues, she felt confident of recognizing any of the several thousand people more or less likely to interact with her at any point in the near future. The list had grown and shrunk down over the years, and many people had dropped off it entirely because of death or distance. Sometimes she added names to the list only to be surprised that they had been on it once before, decades ago, and she had forgotten them completely. That only reinforced the need for the list and the effort to keep it fresh in her mind.</em></blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure that the Dunbar Number problem is solely one of "recognition", as illustrated by Williams and Dix. However, I think this is a great example of seeing how a traditional cultural solution to network overextension (namely, "Spending More Time") can be better applied by Social Software. In this example Melilah's software automates the "ticklers" that politicians use.</p>

<p><img border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/spokekeepintouchsettings.gif style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: right;" title=Spokekeepintouchsettings alt=Spokekeepintouchsettings>Already at least one social networking service has adopted a somewhat similar idea.
<a href="http://center.spoke.com/person/personalProfileTab.spoke?id=[serverID=center,ID=4877427]">Spoke</a> has a "Keep In Touch" setting. The Spoke client software will watch your Outlook mailbox and addressbook to see how often you contact various people, and if you don't email them or modify your address book entry for them periodically, will remind you that you should contact them.</p>

<p>I've never used Spoke's "Keep In Touch" feature -- largely for privacy reasons (I was <a href=../../2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html>stung by a Zero Degrees</a> Outlook extension), but also because Spoke seemed to be oriented toward salespeople and thus emphasized growing the network. My problem is not growing my network, but managing the network I already have more effectively. But I may have to take another look at Spoke. So, it doesn't quite offer the same solution that Melilah used in the far-future, but it's still a start upon that path.</p>

<h4>Conclusions and Questions</h4>

<p>I'm not certain that Spoke's "Keep In Touch" feature, or Melilah's social recognition reminder service are the full solution to the "Dunbar Triage" problem. However, they do at least offer a few examples of people looking at the problems, and how social software can help solve them.</p>

<p>As I've outlined here there are at least three traditional methods  that we've used to manage Dunbar Triage prior to advent of social networking services: spending more time, changing standards, and prioritization. The technological solutions that I've offered up as an example concentrates upon the first of those cultural solutions, but it is by no means a conclusive statement on the issue.</p>

<p>How could next-generation social networking services improve upon the ideas of changing standards or prioritization? Could simple categorization help improve expectations for attention levels that various associates receive from you? Are there ways that social networking services, acting as an intermediary, could better manage disappointment-inducing events, such as a decision to spend less attention on an associate?</p>

<p>More so, could social software offer solutions that aren't even being considered right now? For example, many Cyberpunk novels have suggested the ideas of avatars that can collect information for you on the 'net while your attention is elsewhere. Could these avatars likewise maintain more distant social networks for you, without your full attention? Would that function even be desirable?</p>

<p>Some solutions are not technological -- what new skills and changes to practices, etiquette and ethics are required for our ever expanding network of relationships? Or as <a href=http://alevin.com/weblog/>Adina</a> asks: <em>"Who will offer us a 21st century, internet-augmented take on Dale Carnegie and Emily Post?"</em></p>

<p>As with any problem in the developing technical world, the first step is to define the problem and to consider possible solutions. Here's the start: social networks can become too large, and many social networking services are causing the problem rather than solving it.</p>

<p>What's your solution?</p>

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>As a former Macintosh developer, I've always been disappointed with the user-interface of web pages. The state of the art of UI design moved backwards with the advent of the browser -- we traded connectivity for ease-of-use. With the advent of pages written in Flash, some better user-interfaces were created, but at the important cost of things like being able to copy text, have semantic and meta-data information imbedded in web pages, searchability, etc.</p>

<p>So I keep an eye out for innovative ideas that preserve the essence of what is so powerful about web pages, yet also offer a good ideas. My posts on <a href=../../2004/10/map_mashup.html>Map Mashup</a> and <a href=../../2004/09/tiddlywiki.html>TiddlyWiki</a> offer some interesting web UI exemplars.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;complete=1"><img src=../../images/logo_google_suggest.gif alt=Logo_google_suggest height=79 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Logo_google_suggest></a></p>

<p>To this list of exemplars I now add <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;complete=1">Google Suggest</a> by Google programmer <a href=http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/12/ive-got-suggestion.html>Kevin Gibbs</a>, who wrote this as part of Google employee's ability to work 20% of the time on their own projects.

Google Suggest replaces the browser's default auto-complete with one specific to Google searching. As you type each letter of your search request, you are shown the most popular requests for that term, and how many search hits are available for that search term. You really have to try out to understand how amazing and intuitive it is.</p>

<p>Blogger <a href=http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/>Chris Justus</a> has <a href=http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/2004/12/google-suggest-dissected.html>dissected and documented</a> how Google Suggest works. If you are a web developer, I recommend you read his analysis and I hope it will inspire you.</p>

<p>This specific technique is probably not useful for all web sites -- the amount of load that even a small number of users can place on a database using this technique requires a large server infrastructure, as basically every time you type a letter a database is being hit. Google can do this as they understand server farms and how to scale large loads. However, as inspiration for other ideas, I think it is marvelous.</p>

<p>For instance, I didn't know you could take control over your browsers auto-complete functionality by setting autocomplete="off" in your input field. Given this and the other techniques for display and cursor control, you could create dynamic auto-complete functionality on your own web pages, but skip the bandwidth intensive XMLHttpRequest by either caching the data in your web page, or in a user's cookie, or both. An example of this is <a href=http://blog.bitflux.ch/>BitFlux</a> blog's <a href=http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/livesearch_roundup.html>LiveSearch</a> functionality (which is also documented <a href=http://blog4.bitflux.ch/wiki/LiveSearch>here</a>).</p>

<p>The technique for retrieving the data using XMLHttpRequest is also marvelous. This functionality has been <a href=http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html>around for a while</a> but this is one of the cleanest examples of how to do it on the client side.</p>

<p>I've got some other ideas on how to apply some of these techniques to Wiki pages -- hopefully in the next few months I'll have some proof-of-concept examples for you to play around with.</p>

<p>In addition, Google Suggest is now, in a sense, a new web service from google that can be used independently. For instance Adam Stiles has <a href=http://www.adamstiles.com/adam/2004/12/hacking_google_.html>written</a> about a <a href=http://www.netcaptor.net/adsense/suggest.php>hack</a> to help suggest keywords for AdSense.</p>

<p>The term 'social software', which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush's ideas about 'memex' in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p>

<p>By examining the many terms used to describe today's 'social software' we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how there exists a very real life cycle concerning the use of technical terminology.</p>

<h3>1940s — Memex</h3>

<p>The earliest reference that I can find to people using computers to collaborate with one another is from the 1940s.</p>

<p>Near the end of World War II, in 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote a seminal article on the future of computing in <a href=http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml>As We May Think</a>. In it, he conceived of a device he called the 'memex', which today we might call the personal computer:</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/memex.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=497,height=312,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/memex.jpg alt=Memex height=125 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Memex></a> <blockquote><p><em>"A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory."</em></blockquote>

<p>Later on, the article discusses Memex's further benefits to groups:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outranged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.</em></p>

<p><em>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by its patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior."</em></blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is also the first mention in literature of what will eventually be called hypertext. However, the term 'memex' never caught on - - Vannevar's ideas were way before their time.</p>

<h3>1960's — ARPA and Licklider</h3>

<p><img src=../../images/licklider.jpg alt="J.C.R. Licklider" height=242 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=160 title="J.C.R. Licklider"></p>

<p>It wasn't until the early 1960s that I find the idea of using computers to collaborate came up again.</p>

<p>As a response to the USSR launching Sputnik, the US formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958. In l8 months, ARPA has developed the first successful satellite. In 1962 Dr. J.C.R. Licklider was appointed to head ARPA, and changed ARPA to offer more research grants to universities. In fact, it was due to his efforts that universities offered their first Ph.D.'s in computer science. It was this research that ultimately led to ARPANET, commercial time-sharing systems, and ultimately to the Internet.</p>

<p>Licklider wrote in 1968 in <a href="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research- reports/SRC- 061.pdf#page=26">The Computer as a Communication Device</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"To appreciate the importance the new computer-aided communication can have, one must consider the dynamics of 'critical mass,' as it applies to cooperation in creative endeavor. Take any problem worthy of the name, and you find only a few people who can contribute effectively to its solution. Those people must be brought into close intellectual partnership so that their ideas can come into contact with one another. But bring these people together physically in one place to form a team, and you have trouble, for the most creative people are often not the best team players, and there are not enough top positions in a single organization to keep them all happy. Let them go their separate ways, and each creates his own empire, large or small, and devotes more time to the role of emperor than to the role of problem solver. The principals still get together at meetings. They still visit one another. But the time scale of their communication stretches out, and the correlations among mental models degenerate between meetings so that it may take a year to do a week’s communicating. There has to be some way of facilitating communication among people without bringing them together in one place."</em></blockquote>

<p>Here you see Licklider really speaking of more than just communication. He also describes about methods of collaboration and how people function in groups.</p>

<h3>1960s — Augmentation</h3>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/doug_engelbart_collage.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=410,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/doug_engelbart_collage.jpg alt=Doug_engelbart_collage height=128 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Doug_engelbart_collage></a></p>

<p>One of the early ARPA research projects was at SRI, where <a href=http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/englebart.html>Doug Englebart</a>, inspired by Vannevar Bush's vision, set up a research lab that created an elaborate hypermedia system called NLS (oNLine System). This was the first successful implementation of hypertext (though that term was not invented until later), and it was here that the mouse was invented as well as the first on-screen video teleconference.</p>

<p>Engelbart's seminal work was <a href=http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/friedewald030402/augmentinghumanintellect/ahi62index.html>Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework</a>, which he wrote in 1962. In it he set out his basic idea of augmentation:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"By 'augmenting human intellect' we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by 'complex situations' we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human 'feel for a situation' usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids."</em></blockquote>

<p>He was also among the first to say that in order to design such tools, we must:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"integrate psychology and organizational development with all of these advances in computing technology."</em></blockquote>

<p>Over time this term evolved to become called 'office augmentation' -- Englebart preferred the term 'augmentation' over almost anywhere that 'automation' was used, as automation seem de-personalizing. However, Englebart's work was ultimately sold by SRI to Tymshare, where they commercialized it under their newly formed "Office Automation Division". Thus it appears that term 'automation' won over the term 'augmentation', and Englebart's ideas of integrating psychology and organization development were lost.</p>

<h3>1970s — Office Automation</h3>

<p>IBM coined the term 'word processing' in the 1960s, which originally encompassed all business equipment -- including manually operated typewriters -- that was concerned with the handling of text, as opposed to data. By the 70s they were attempting to broaden the scope of their products to all aspects of the office, so they coined the term 'office automation'.</p>

<p>The use of this term swiftly become quite generic, and was used by all the major computer companies of the time. However, any ideas of collaboration become lost in the ideas of process and automation.</p>

<h3><a name=EIES></a>1970s — Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES)</h3>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/planet_ti_eies.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=269,height=342,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/planet_ti_eies.gif alt=Planet_ti_eies height=254 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Planet_ti_eies></a></p>

<p>Yet the number of successful product lines bearing the tag 'office automation' did mean that there was increased research money for creating new tools. One of the most important was a project called <a href=http://www.wikiworld.com/wiki/index.php/EIES%20Legacy>Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES)</a>, which had funding from for-profit companies like IBM and AT&amp;T, non-profit foundations like the Annenberg Trust, and governmental agencies like NSF and the New Jersey Commission of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>EIES was the first major implementation of collaborative software. In a <a href=http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/Papers/DelphiConference.pdf>paper</a> from 1972, EIES founder <a href=http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/>Murray Turoff</a> describes an early version of EIES:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"Basically the Delphi Conference appears to have utility when one or more of the following conditions were met:</em><blockquote>

<li><em> the group cannot meet often enough in committee to give adequate timely consideration to the topic because of time or distance constraints</em></li>

<li><em> there is a specific reason to preserve the anonymity of the conferees (e.g., refereeing of position papers or a free exchange among different levels in an organizational structure)</em></li>

<li><em> the group is too large for an effective conference telephone call or committee exchange</em></li>

<li><em> the group is interdisciplinary to the extent that a structured or refereed communication mode as opposed to a committee or panel approach is more desirable in promoting an efficient exchange of information</em></li>

<li><em> telephone and letter communications, on a one-to-one basis, are insufficient or too cumbersome to augment the particular committee activity</em></li>

<li><em> disagreement among members of the group are too severe for a meaningful committee of face-to-face process for the exchange of views and information. </em></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>You can see from this list that EIES pioneered many of the concepts of BBS- style community software that we see today. Ultimately EIES featured threaded-replies, anonymous messages, polling, etc. Also, note the early importance of trying to understand groups so that you can optimize for the best group process.</p>

<p>However, as a generic term, EIES was too cumbersome. I see references from that period to terms like 'decision support system', 'computer-mediated communications', and 'collective intelligence', but none of these were broadly adopted either.</p>

<h3>1980s — Groupware (Part 1)</h3>

<p><img border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ptjl.jpg style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title=Ptjl alt=Ptjl></p>

<p><a href=http://www.awakentech.com/at/Awaken.nsf/d4cbbb795713bdee882564640074729d/8d2c4ffefd30d8b7882564650009851a!OpenDocument>Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz</a> are credited by many as coining the term 'groupware' in <a href=http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC23/JnsnLenz.htm>1978</a>, after experiencing EIES for the first time. They defined groupware as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"intentional group processes plus software to support them."</em></blockquote>

<p>I have long preferred this definition for two reasons -- first, the word intentional implies conscious design. Second, this definition also contains the important distinction that group processes come before the software. I felt that this definition properly excluded multi-user databases and electronic mail that are not designed specifically to enhance the group process. (I wrote about this in an 1990 article called <a href=http://www.alacritymanagement.com/DoG.html>Definitions of Groupware</a>.)</p>

<p>There were a number of other definitions during that period:</p>

<blockquote>
    <li><a href=http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/englebart.html>Doug Engelbart</a> — <em>"A co-evolving human-tool system."</em></li>
    
    <li><a href=http://www.collaborate.com/about/about_david_coleman.html>David Coleman</a> — <em>"Computer-mediated collaboration that increases the productivity or functionality of person-to-person processes."</em></li>
    
    <li><a href=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~skip/Home.html>C.A. 'Skip' Ellis</a> - - <em>"Computer-based systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) and that provide an interface to a shared environment."</em></li>
</blockquote>

<p>Very swiftly, the term 'groupware' was adopted by the EIES community, as well as many of the spinoff software that was developed in the early 80's. However, the term was not broadly adopted outside of this community for some time.</p>

<h3>1980s — Computer-Supported Collaborative (or sometimes Cooperative) Work (CSCW)</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, the academic community was not happy with either the term 'office automation' or 'groupware' for research into how groups use computers to collaborate.</p>

<p>After the failure of an ACM conference on Office Automation, MIT's <a href=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/greif.html>Irene Greif</a> and DEC's Paul Cashman coined the term CSCW for a workshop held in 1984, which was followed by the first CSCW conference in 1986. There is still an annual <a href=http://www.acm.org/cscw2004/index.html>CSCW Conference</a>, which this year is being held in Chicago on November 6-10th.</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/cc.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=600,height=400,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/cc.gif alt=Cc height=133 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Cc></a></p>

<p>The people initially involved with this conference came from either Human Computer Interaction (HCI) background or Information Systems (IS) background, thus the different definitions for the second 'C' in 'CSCW'; the HCI people preferred the small team focused 'cooperative', whereas the IS people chose the broader 'collaborative'. <a href=http://www.msu.edu/~schopie1/talk_rosewood_03-04-16.html>Scott Schopieray</a> has a nice diagram about this on the right.</p>

<p>The <a href=http://www.dml.cs.ucf.edu/cybrary/fyi_cscw.html>Digital Media Laboratory</a> defines CSCW as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"a multidisciplinary research field including computer science, economics, sociology, and psychology. CSCW research focuses on developing new theories and technologies for coordination of groups of people who work together."</em></blockquote>

<p><a href=http://www.sigmod.org/sigmod/dblp/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wilson:Brian.html>Brian Wilson</a> defined it as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"CSCW is a generic term which combines the understanding of the way people work in groups with the enabling technologies of computer networking, and associated hardware, software, services and techniques."</em></blockquote>

<p>However, most definitions I've seen compare it to groupware:</p>

<blockquote>
    <li><a href=http://www.telekooperation.de/cscw/cscw.html>Applied Informatics and Distributed Systems Group at Technische Universitat Munchen</a> — <em>"While Groupware refers to the real computer-based systems, the notion CSCW means the study of tools and techniques of Groupware as well as their psychological, social and organizational effects."</em></li>
    
    <li><a href=http://www.infres.enst.fr/~vercken/multicast/cscw.html>Tom Brink</a> — <em>"Groupware is often used to specifically denote the technology that people use to work together, whereas CSCW refers to the field that studies the use of that technology."</em></li>
</blockquote>

<p>This term never really was adopted by anyone except the academic community, and even now, there are many that prefer different terms, such as 'social computing' or 'coordination science'. <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/>danah boyd</a> offered this comment to me in an email:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"In the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) space (those who address this area in academia), one switch has been to 'social computing' and the move was far more intentional. CSCW comes out of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) paradigm.  By and large, HCI has been strongly associated with quantitative psychology in terms of methods.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>

<p><em>Groupware and collaborative software have a heavy handed connotation of 'work' (deeply connected to HCI's emphasis on activity theory).  While CSCW has the term work directly embedded in it, there's a strong push towards other aspects of social life.  Qualitative approaches have been infused into HCI and HCI practitioners are drawing heavily from sociology and anthropology, focusing directly on everyday social life. [This move may also be a purposeful move towards Marx, but maybe i'm reading too far into things.]"</em></blockquote>

<h3>1990's — Groupware (Part 2)</h3>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/grove_groupware.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=558,height=437,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/grove_groupware.gif alt=Grove_groupware height=156 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Grove_groupware></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the term 'groupware' hit the mainstream in 1988, when Robert Johansen wrote the best-selling business book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0029164915/skotos-20/104-8061732- 6194323">Groupware: Computer Support for Business Teams</a>. One unique contribution that Johansen's book offered was a distinction between time and place for different types of collaboration. See the diagram on the right for some detail.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was this success that was also the downfall of the term 'groupware', for it got co-opted by marketing. Initially the co-opting was done by Lotus Notes, which I personally didn't feel deserved to be called groupware, as it was really more of a multi-user database that could be used to make groupware, but wasn't actually groupware. Then Microsoft further corrupted the term when they released Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook with calendaring features to compete with Lotus Notes, and called that groupware as well.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.fudco.com/chip/>Chip Morningstar</a>, an early pioneer in collaboration software and virtual worlds, comments:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"(in the 1990's) I know that we (the Xanadu/AMIX community) hated the term 'groupware', as would anyone who has any respect for the English language. Also, at the time, the term was generally applied to things like Lotus Notes, which we felt was in a category distinct from what we were doing."</em></blockquote>

<p>Currently Wikipedia <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupware>defines groupware</a> as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"software that integrates work on a single project by several concurrent users at separated workstations"</em></blockquote>

<p>Thus today almost any software that supports multiple users can somewhat legitimately say that they are 'groupware'.</p>

<h3>1990s — Origin of Social Software</h3>

<p>While the term 'groupware' was slowly losing its meaning, a new phrase, 'social software' was beginning to coming into vogue. However, for the first 15 years of its existence, mostly in the 1990s, the term was rarely used outside of very specialized groups.</p>

<p>One of the best ways I've found to see how words, terms, phrases, and memes spread through culture is looking through Google's marvelous archive of usenet newsgroups. Searching by date, the earliest reference I can find to the term 'social software' is a posting in <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22social+software%22&amp;start=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr =&amp;ie=UTF- 8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;scoring=d&amp;selm=Aug.9.00.45.25.1990.28902%40athos.rutgers.edu &amp;rnum=101">1990</a> -- in this newsgroup posting it isn't really clear what the definition of social software is, only that it is associated with 'open hypertext' and a committee in Japan to study 'social-hyper computing'. The next mention of social software is in <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22social+software%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF- 8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;scoring=d&amp;selm=Feb.12.22.44.50.1992.14723%40planchet.rutgers.edu&amp;rnum=100">1992</a> in which Ted Nelson's Xanadu and Phil Salin's AMIX are called social software.</p>

<p>The next couple of years of usage of the term social software appear to be largely associated with the nanotechnology community and those influenced by them, or by the diaspora of people who left Xanadu and AMIX when they were both closed by Autodesk. Given these references, my first guess was that the term originated within Xanadu/AMIX communities, as they had close connections with many of the people involved with nanotechnology.</p>

<p><img border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/drexler.jpg style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="K. Eric Drexler" alt="K. Eric Drexler"> </p>

<p>However, after contacting some of my collegues that used to work for Xanadu or AMIX, they say the term probably came from K. Eric Drexler, founder of the <a href=http://www.foresight.org/>Foresight Institute</a>. Drexler is best known for coining the term <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology>nanotechnology</a>, and his interest in hypertext and group augmentation comes from his desire to make sure that we think critically about the technology before we develop it.</p>

<p>The earliest reference that I can find to term 'social software' in his writings is in <a href=http://www.islandone.org/Foresight/WebEnhance/HPEK1.html>Hypertext Publishing and the Evolution of Knowledge</a>, originally published at the Hypertext '87 Conference, but updated online though 1997), where the term is used three times, in the following contexts:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>KINDS OF HYPERTEXT<br>...<br><strong>Filtered vs. bare hypertext:</strong> A system that shows users all local links (no matter how numerous or irrelevant) is bare hypertext. A system that enables users to automatically display some links and hide others (based on user-selected criteria) is filtered hypertext. This implies support for what may be termed <strong>social software</strong>, including voting and evaluation schemes that provide criteria for later filtering.<br>...<br>AGENT LEVELS<br>...<br>Agents can also implement social software functions - for example, applying voting-and-rating algorithms to sets of reader evaluations and publishing the results.<br>...<br>IMPROVING PROBLEM SOLVING<br>...<br>A hypertext publishing medium will have abilities beyond supporting improved critical discussion. Since it is computer-based, it can naturally support software for collaborative development of modeling games and simulations [29] (and enable effective criticism of published model structures and parameters). Social software could facilitate group commitment and action: individuals could take unpublicized positions of the form I will publicly commit to X if Y other people do so at the same time. Once Y people take a compatible position, everyone's commitment (to making a statement, forming a group, making a contribution, etc.) could be automatically published. The possibilities for hypertext-based social software seem broad.</em></blockquote>

<p>I wrote Eric to find out why he used the term, and this was his reply:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"I don't recall when I began using it (it wasn't in Engines of Creation), but it does seem to me, as best I can recall, that I coined it.</em></p>

<p><em>I used the term 'social software' because I am concerned with communication and collaboration on all scales, including the whole of society. Thus, I see media at the scale of the World Wide Web as forms of social software.</em></p>

<p><em>We need to make society-scale conflict -- not just group-scale cooperation -- more productive. Better media, better social software, can help.</em></p>

<p><em>I'd rather see an emphasis on this dimension of social software than on the origin of the name itself."</em></blockquote>

<p>Drexler's term 'social software' didn't initially take off. There do not appear to be many consistent mentions of the term in the late 90's. There continue to be references that I attribute to the term spreading out from the nanotechnology community, but also I see references to the 'social software' of the brain. There also seem to be a few consulting companies named Social Software but none appear to have had much success. Wiki was invented in 1995, but I don't see it, or any of the subsequent wikis defining themselves as social software for a number of years.</p>

<h3>2000s — Evolution of Social Software</h3>

<p><img border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/clayshirky.jpg style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title=Clayshirky alt=Clayshirky></p>

<p>It isn't until late 2002 that the term 'social software' came into more common usage, probably due to the efforts of <a href=http://www.shirky.com/>Clay Shirky</a> who organized a "Social Software Summit" in November of 2002. He recalls his first usage of the term to be from approximately April of 2002.</p>

<p>I asked Clay if it was the loss of meaning in the terms 'groupware' that made him choose the term 'social software', and he replied:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"I was looking for something that gathered together all uses of software that supported interacting groups, <strong>even if the interaction was offline</strong>, e.g. Meetup, nTag, etc. Groupware was the obvious choice, but had become horribly polluted by enterprise groupware work."</em></blockquote>

<p>I asked him why he didn't use the term 'collaborative software' and he commented:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"...because that seems a sub-set of groupware, leaving out other kinds of group processes such as discussion, mutual advice or favors, and play.</em></p>

<p><em>The broader issue is that there was no word or phrase that grouped the CSCW and online community currents together without also including a lot of non-group oriented stuff. CMC (Computer-Mediated Communication) for example, includes broadcast outlets like C|Net, two-person email exchanges, and spam -- much too broad. There was also no word or phrase that called attention to the explosion of interesting software for group activities that fell outside online communities and CSCW, things like Bass-Station (which is for offline community) or "Uncle Roy is All Around You" (which is computer-supported collaborative play.)"</em></blockquote>

<p>Clay also offered me some interesting commentary on the term 'social computing':</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"On a side note, there is in the research community a similar phrase, 'social computing', that both MSFT and IBM use. I think this phrase also doesn't fit the domain well. It seems to suffer from Shannon Envy, where the researchers interested in social effects are trying to convince their colleagues that what they are working on is also computing.</em></p>

<p><em>I think the 'social computing' phrase is a shame for two reasons. First, there's no need to apologize for studying social effects by pretending that they are a form of computing (the old argument about computers as computing vs communicating devices goes back to Licklider in the early 60s, and its disheartening to see the communications people agonizing over it 40 years on).</em></p>

<p><em>Second, the phrase social computing could describe a really interesting domain, where groups are used to find approximately optimal solutions to hard combinatorial problems."</em></blockquote>

<h3>2000s — Changing Definitions of Social Software</h3>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ryzeblogtribefriends.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=579,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/ryzeblogtribefriends.gif alt=Ryzeblogtribefriends height=181 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Ryzeblogtribefriends></a></p>

<p>An early definition by Clay for the definition of social software was:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"1. Social software treats triads of people differently than pairs.<br> 2. Social software treats groups as first-class objects in the system."</em></blockquote>

<p>However, Clay more recently prefers the simpler:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"software that supports group interaction"</em></blockquote>

<p>I note that this is quite a bit closer to the Johnson-Lenz definition of groupware.</p>

<p>One of areas of disagreement about the definition of social software is one of scope. <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SunirShah>Sunir Shah</a> host of <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki>MeatballWiki</a> conceives of social software as being mainly about support for online communities, whereas Clay Shirky desires for it to also:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"explicitly try to include online support for both lightweight social value (e.g. del.icio.us) and offline interaction (e.g. Dodgeball, PacManhattan) in the definition."</em></blockquote>

<p>There is a long discussion on Meatball Wiki at <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SocialSoftware>SocialSoftware</a> on this topic. One of the more interesting definitions comes from <a href=http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2002/12/on_the_augmentation_of_human_social_networking_abilities.shtml>Tom Coates</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"augmentation of human's socializing and networking abilities by software, complete with ways of compensating for the overloads this might engender"</em></blockquote>

<p>I asked <a href=http://alevin.com/weblog/>Adina Levin</a>, of <a href=http://www.socialtext.com>SocialText</a>, about her thoughts on why we are now using the term 'social software' and not some other term. She said:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"I believe that there are new things in social software, but we're also compelled to use new words instead of building on the old ones because of the way the discourse works.</em></p>

<p><em>When you talk about 'groupware', people think of the hard-to-use, under-adopted Lotus Notes category. In the mid-90s, groupware and knowledge management were used for software that represented the taylorization of knowledge work – the idea that you can automate knowledge work into pre-defined workflows and "capture the assets" in people's brains. Often, the ideas sound good to managers, but the tools did little for the people using them. There were fancy schemes intended to "incent participation" because the tools didn't do much for the people using them without lollipops. Email had massive adoption, and more complex tools often gathered dust.</em></p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, the term 'virtual community' became associated with discredited ideas about cyberspace as an independent polity, and failed dotcom ideas about assembling community in the shadow of a mass-market brand such as forums on the Coca Cola site. 

</em></p>

<p><em>Several years ago, in the depths of the tech recession, there were signs of creative life in weblog and journal communities, conversation discovery with daypop and then technorati, the growth curve of wikipedia, mobile games, photo and playlist sharing. The liveliness was about the communities, and also about the culture of tool mix'n'match <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+bricolage">bricolage</a>. Many of the attributes of social software -– hyperlinks for naming and reference, weblog conversation discovery, standards-based aggregation -– build on older forms. But the difference in scale, standardization, simplicity, and social incentives provided by web access turn a difference in degree to a difference in kind.</em></p>

<p><em>These forms grew without any forced discussion "how to incent participation". People are compelled to write blogs and journals to show off and to share, to contribute to wikipedia and open source software projects for the joy of building things with other people. There are some lessons about social patterns and social affordances that this generation of social software communities and tools get right, are worth understanding and building on.</em></p>

<p><em>We might be better off as a culture if we used rhetorical techniques from traditional cultures to appropriate the words of the previous generation, but deepen them with new insights from the current generation. But we're children of the enlightenment, we want progress, and in order to get the (deserved) attention for new generations of real innovation, we need to use new terms."</em></blockquote>

<h3>2010 — Future Thoughts on Social Software</h3>

<p><img src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/vrconf.jpg alt="VR Conference" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" class=image-full border=0 title="VR Conference">

</p>

<p>In examining the origins of 'social software' we can see the terminology for the field has moved through a sort of life cycle. There have been many terms for this type of software, some of which have taken off, and some of which have not.</p>

<p>Typically, a visionary originates a term, and a community around that visionary may (or may not) adopt it. The diaspora of the term from that point can be slow, with 10 or 15 years passing before a term is more generally adopted. Once a term is more broadly adopted, it faces the risk of becoming a marketing term, corrupted into differentiating products rather than explaining ideas.</p>

<p>Is 'social software', which just now gaining wide acceptance, destined for the same trash heap of uselessness as groupware? And, if so, what impact does the changing of this terminology have on the field of social software itself? Only the future holds those answers ...</p>

                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p><a href=http://www.jotspot.com/about/index.php>Joe Kraus</a>, one of the co-founders of Excite, and new <a href=http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/>blogger</a> has long been <a href=http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/wiki_and_then_s.html>rumored</a> to be working on a new wiki tool. Today at the <a href=http://www.web2con.com/pub/w/32/program.html>Web 2.0</a> conference Joe finally unveiled <a href=http://www.jotspot.com>JotSpot</a>, a new type of wiki that they have named an "Application Wiki". JotSpot appears to be not only an advanced wiki, but it also moves the predominantly text-based wiki toward being able to handle structured data and web application development.</p>

<p><img border=0 src=http://www.jotspot.com/tours/advanced/img/slide09.jpg style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;">At the JotSpot website there is an page on <a href=http://jot.com/compare/index.php>How JotSpot is Different</a> and an <a href=http://jot.com/tours/advanced/1.php>Advanced Tour</a> of this wiki's database capabilities.</p>

<p>Better, however, is a demonstration that Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer gave InfoWorld reporter <a href=http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/06.html#a1090>Jon Udell</a> an early <a href=http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/jot.swf>demo of JotSpot</a>, which Jon screen-captured and has released as a 23-minute, 32MB Flash presentation. This demo is very impressive: in addition to incremental improvements to wiki, such as WYSIWYG editing, email support, indexed attachments, RSS and web page importing, etc.  Kraus and Spencer also demonstrate a very powerful forms templating interface that is very much like creating HTML forms with Javascript, and demonstrated integration with a <a href=http://www.salesforce.com>SalesForce.com</a> web application using SOAP. It appears that JotSpot leverages the unstructured and adhoc advantages that are a strength of wiki, yet allows structure to be added later such that the data in the wiki can be integrated with other non-wiki applications.</p>

<p>The discussion during the demo is also very interesting. Jon Udell made an observation about JotSpot entering into Lotus Notes territory, and Kraus and Spencer discuss how JotSpot makes web application development more accessible, and expressed their desire to create a marketplace for small developers to create tools using JotSpot.</p>

<p>From what I've seen so far, JotSpot looks like it may the first of a third-generation of wikis, the first being the very simple wikis such as <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham>Ward Cunningham's</a> <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki>C2 Wiki</a>, and second generation being database-backed wikis such as <a href=http://www.wikipedia.com>Wikipedia</a> and <a href=http://www.socialtext.com>SocialText</a>. If you are serious about wiki, I highly recommend you take a look at this demo.</p>

<p>Joe Kraus also announced today that they have received a $5.2M funding round from <a href=http://www.redpoint.com>Redpoint</a> and <a href=http://mayfield.com>Mayfield</a>, both top VC firms.</p>

<p>MultiMap is a company that sells maps and aerial photos, primarily for Great Britain. They offer an online map tool that is very similar to that used by MapQuest or Yahoo Maps.</p>

<p>However, for certain regions, they have this fabulous capability to show you the aerial photo of the place, then display hovering around the cursor a slightly transparent map. For instance, take a look at this map of <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/photo.cgi?client=public&amp;X=533258&amp;Y=180057&amp;width=500&amp;height=310&amp;gride=529090&amp;gridn=179645&amp;srec=0&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;db=pc&amp;pc=&amp;zm=0&amp;scale=10000&amp;up.x=186&amp;up.y=3">the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>This trick is done completely in Javascript, located in <a href=http://www.multimap.com/static/global.js>global.js</a>, and uses the overlay.style.* properties that I've really only seen used in Javascript-based menus before. I'm a bit confused on how this works in IE, as it does not support alpha tranparency as this posting <a href=http://persistent.info/archives/2004/04/27/overlays>semi-transparent image overlays</a> discusses, but I suspect they accomplished it through careful use of transparency in the .gif overlay image. I'll have to investigate more.</p>

<p>There are probably many more other innovative uses of this type of transparency overlay tracking to the cursor that can be helpful in other web tools.</p>

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>I keep an eye out for new ideas in Wiki technology (see my post from February <a href=../../2004/02/looking_at_wiki.html>Looking at Wiki</a>), and I recently became fascinated by <a href=http://www.tiddlywiki.com/>TiddlyWiki</a>. It is sort of a one-page client-only Wiki written completely in Javascript and HTML. Like my <a href=http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net>EditThisPagePHP</a>, it appears to be an elegant experiment to look into the future of this medium of user-editable content.</p>

<p>The key feature of TiddlyWiki is that instead of <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiName>WikiName</a> links leading to new pages, it displays a new set of <a href="http://www.cmswiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=MicroContent">microcontent</a> at the top of the current page, pushing your previous content toward the bottom of the page. Thus your link history is all on a single page rather then through your browser's back button. You really need to try it out to understand it.</p>

<p>In its current form, TiddlyWiki is still really more a technology demonstration than a useful tool, as you can't save the changes you make. However, there are people that are creating a <a href=http://www.patrickcurry.com/tiddly/>PHP TiddlyWink</a> based on it.</p>

<p>There are a number of things about TiddlyWiki that interest me. One is that it is more microcontent focused, rather then page focused. I've seen a few attempts to do blogs in Wikis and to date I have been unsatisfied -- part of the reason is that most blogs consist primarily of a chronological series of microcontent, whereas Wikis tend to be more oriented around pages. The ideas in TiddlyWiki may offer an alternative.</p>

<p>Another unique aspect of TiddlyWiki is its approach to link history. I'm not sure if new microcontent should appear at the top, as it does in TiddlyWiki, or at the bottom, but it certainly is an useful experiment.</p>

<p>TiddlyWiki also seems to also be an interesting way to create hypertext stories -- see for instance see the interactive fiction <a href=http://scribbling.net/projects/tiddlywiki/BabyDogSitter.html>Baby Dog Sitter</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I see TiddlyWiki as an encouragement to other Wiki designers to see what can be done with client-side Javascripts. One of the reasons that <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> feels so responsive is due to its use of Javascript, and <a href=http://www.oddpost.com>OddPost</a> does some amazing things emulating the Outlook mail client exclusively using Javascript inside a web page. <a href=http://www.flexwiki.com>FlexWiki</a> is one of the few other Wikis that use Javascript in novel ways; however, they are Microsoft-centric rather than standards-centric, so I've heard that some of their features don't work on Mozilla-family browsers. I'd like to see more experimentation combining Javascript and Wiki.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing what shakes out as this tool matures.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>A number of my posts have been about integrating different domains of knowledge in order to better understand how human behavior should be incorporated in the design of social software. I found <a href=../../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>The Dunbar Number</a> in sociology, and both <a href=../../2004/04/four_kinds_of_p.html>Four Kinds of Privacy</a> and <a href=../../2004/08/progressive_tru.html>Progressive Trust</a> come from my work in the cryptography field. The topic of this post comes from the field of architecture.</p>

<p>In order to provide for <a href=../../2004/08/progressive_tru.html>Progressive Trust</a>, you need to establish what is known as an "Intimacy Gradient".</p>

<p>The concept of Intimacy Gradient comes from architect Christopher Alexander, in his book <a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. (Oxford University Press, 1977)</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn127.html>Pattern #127 - Intimacy Gradient:</a>

</i><p><i><b>Conflict:</b> Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence which corresponds to their degrees of privateness, the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family, will always be a little awkward.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i><b>Resolution:</b> Lay out the spaces of a building so that they create a sequence which begins with the entrance and the most public parts of the building, then leads into the slightly more private areas, and finally to the most private domains.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In architecture there are always some areas of the house or building that are more public -- the entry, the living room, the atrium, etc., and areas that are more private such as bathrooms, bedrooms, and offices. In a good design there is some marker of change between these different areas -- it might be a difference in ceiling height, a stairway leading to a different floor, or a narrow entrance. As an example, in the classical Japanese tea house, you have to bow low before entering.</p>

<p>Failure to respect the Intimacy Gradient results in uncomfortable buildings. <a href=http://munnecke.com/gehry.htm>Tom Munnecke</a> reported about a Frank Gehry building at Case Western Reserve University:</p>

<blockquote><p><i> I asked many of the graduate students how they felt about their new environment. "Horrible," said one. "Like living in a refrigerator" said another. "We used to have comfortable offices and gathering places, and had the most wonderful conversations. Now everything is so sterile, and the acoustics so bad, that we can't do anything together. I have to go outside if I want any privacy."</i></blockquote>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient is also used in other media. As I noted in my review of <a href=../../2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html>Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>When we arrived, we were led down the side of the theatre and all of a sudden I noticed that it looked like we were all being led backstage. We curve around and all of a sudden see an entrance -- maybe 5 foot tall requiring most of us to duck. We duck through and to our surprise, we are have walked through a fridgerator, and we are on the stage!

</i><p><i>One of the 7 players welcomes us, and another offers random people a glass of tea as we walk across the stage to our seats. The stage is set like a city loft, with a tv, some couches, a bed, a bathtub and shower, a kitchen, and of course the fridgerator we entered through. On the stage, and chatting to members of the audience are the 7 cast members, all wearing comfortable looking white shorts or athletic and white t-shirts.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i>The audience arrives over 30 minutes and the 7 players act as if we are guests of their loft, serving some of us tea, chatting, sweeping the floor, etc.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Entering through the refrigerator door raised the intimacy of the experience for the audience of that circus. Thus in spite of it being produced in a large auditorium it felt as up-close and personal as did the much smaller <a href=../../2004/08/circus_contrapt.html>Circus Contraption</a>.</p>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient exists in movies as well -- anywhere you see a scene taking place in a public space that transitions down through smaller and tighter shots ultimately to a closeup of a face it is much more intimate then just cutting to the closeup.</p>

<p>In social software design, there also needs to be an Intimacy Gradient. One of the problems with Wikis is that there is often very little transition between public and intimate, and doing so can be quite jarring. SocialText, a Wiki service vendor, is aware of this problem and is <a href=http://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001393.html>"seeking to add more layers to the 'intimacy gradient', without recreating the highly structured collaboration tools that exist today"</a>. Ross Mayfield outlines <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/12/collaboration_cases_and_spaces.php>this possible future Intimacy Gradient for SocialText</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>
</i><ul><li><i>The broadest tier is a guest space, available to all</i></li><i>
<li>The second tier is a knowledgebase, accessible to all employees and contractors</li>
<li>The third tier is product development, for employees and contractors bound by a confidentiality agreement</li>
<li>The fourth tier is for the core management team to share confidential financial and HR information.</i></ul><p></blockquote>

<p>These thoughts from an earlier post by <a href="">Ross</a> are also thoughtful:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is right that groupthink is avoided by a social network structure that allows a dynamic and diverse periphery to provide new ideas, but the core of the network needs to be tightly bound to be able to take action. 

</i><p><i>That's the main point of Building Sustainable Communities through Network Building by <a href=http://www.orgnet.com>Valdis Krebs</a> and June Holley. When studying a <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/categories/socialNetworks/2003/01/07.html>community over time</a>, they suggest a vibrant community is made up of four stages: </i></p><i>

<ol><li>Scattered Clusters</li>
<li>Single Hub-and-Spoke</li>
<li>Multi-Hub Small-World Network</li>
<li>Core/Periphery</ol>

</i><p><i>The ideal core/periphery structure affords a densely linked core and a dynamic periphery. One pattern for social software that supports this is an <a href=http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P127.htm>intimacy gradient</a> (privacy/openness), to allow the core some privacy for backchannelling. But this requires ridiculously easy group forming, as the more hardened the space the more hard-nosed its occupants become.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>This is not just a problem for Wiki. There is an excellent paper on the web called <a href=http://www.ai.mit.edu/~konrad/docs/IJMMS-patterns-junestrand-keijer-tollmar.pdf>Design Patterns for Private and Public Digital Spaces in the Home Environment</a> where they explore how people used VNC (video-mediated communications, or more colloquially video-chat). They state:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The earlier "public" character of a traditional farmer's house or bourgeois flat (in Sweden) has disappeared with the modern housing planning. Instead, distinguishing the public from the private has become central during the industrial age, with the dwelling as an exclusively private place. Now, with the transition to an information society, it seems as if the concept of public space in the private dwelling has to be reconsidered, which also means that the borders between the private and the public at home have to be opened up.</i></blockquote>

<p>The need to provide for an Intimacy Gradient in social software is clear; however, the techniques for showing the transitions between the gradients are not. For instance, in the original Netscape Communicator, when you connected with a secure SSL connection, the border around the edge of the window would turn blue, and a solid blue key would show up. However, most people didn't notice this change and no current browser does this; even the little locked icon at the bottom of Internet Explorer and often isn't visible if you have the status bar turned off or if you are using frames.</p>

<p><a href=http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001289.htm>Flemming Funch</a> (and <a href=http://www.redtailcanyon.com/items/278391.aspx>mirror</a>) notes part of the difficulty is:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As long as a certain chat room or Wiki page is accessible directly with a deep link, it is going to be very hard to make it feel more intimate than any other place I can reach with similar ease. So a hierarchical structure of links doesn't do it. On the web you can't force people to accept your hierarchy if it is all just links.</i></blockquote>

<p>Part of the solution might come from the architecture world as well -- here are some other Patterns by Christopher Alexander (see the link for Alexander's resolutions for each):</p>

<ul><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn31.html>Pattern #31 - Promenade:</a> Each subculture needs a center for its public life: a place where you can go to see people, and to be seen.</li>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn61.html>Pattern #61 - Small Public Squares:</a> A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public rooms, that a town has. but when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn69.html>Pattern #69 - Public Outdoor Room:</a> There are very few spots along the streets of modern towns and neighborhoods where people can hang out, comfortably, for hours at a time.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn142.html>Pattern #42 - Sequence of Sitting Spaces:</a> Every corner of a building is a potential sitting space. But each sitting space has different needs for comfort and enclosure according to its position in the intimacy gradient.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li><p><a href=http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn147.html>Pattern #147 - Communal Eating":</a> Without communal eating, no human group can hold together.</ul><p></p>

<p>Other lessons for social software from the architecture world are the concepts of "refuge and prospect", the "savanna theory", and "defensible space".</p>

<p><i>Refuge and prospect</i> come from the landscape architect <a href=http://www.landscaperesearch.org.uk/extra31/refuge.htm>Jay Appleton</a>. Prospect is a place where we can see others, and refuge is a place were we can retreat and conceal ourselves. A specific prediction of his theory is that people prefer the edges of a space more then the middle. Often prospect and refuge are in conflict, as a prospect tends to be expansive and bright whereas a refuge is small and dark, but there are cases where they are combined in one place; this is why we value private homes with a spectacular view so much, and why we pay so much to stay at <a href=http://www.djc.com/news/ae/11127729.html>scenic retreats</a>. So what are the edges of our social spaces? Are there ways that we can signal either prospect and refuge?</p>

<p>The <i>savanna theory</i> comes from a hypothesis by <a href=http://notes.utk.edu/bio/greenberg.nsf/0/f60081ef35fba95c85256e6e006a2a77?OpenDocument>Richard Coss and Gordon Orians</a> that we should be most comfortable with those landscapes where humans spent most of their evolutionary past. Thus supposedly the ideal landscape design has the same proportionality of trees, grass, and brush as the African savanna; parks and golf clubs are shown as evidence of this theory. An alternate to this theory is that we desire a certain amount of <a href=http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/institutes/urbanethology/student/html/erich/synekpro.html>visual complexity</a>. Either theory raises this question: what are the evolutionary markers regarding groups that our human ancestors needed? This question fits well with my thoughts regarding the <a href=../../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>defensible space</i> concept comes from the idea that anonymous spaces lead to problems because of vandalism, incivility, and crime, and to eliminate those problems requires the residents to mark their "territories" and "take possession" of their areas. We have similar problems in the online world. So maybe the answer is similar -- allow more ways for groups of people to mark up and take possession of their own virtual spaces.</p>

<p>There are a couple of links that integrate these ideas in architecture that you might find useful:<br>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.wbdg.org/design/resource.php?cn=0&amp;rp=181">Psychosocial Value of Space</a></li><br>

<li><a href=http://www.contemporary.ab.ca/ke/content/pdf/evolutionary_psychology.pdf>Evolutionary Psychology and Workplace Design (pdf)</a></ul><p></p>

<p>We are still breaking ground and exploring new ideas in the world of social software. However, there are already extant fields of study which may give us insight into this new venue. Architecture is one of them. By better understanding ideas of intimacy gradients, pattern language, refuge and prospect, savannas, and defensible spaces, we may gain new understandings of how to build social environments which are attractive and enjoyable to more people.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>I believe that as we evolve social software to better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in, we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work.</p>

<p>One useful concept I use I call "Progressive Trust". The basic idea is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, rather then solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust.</p>

<p>This is how I typically explain progressive trust when I meet someone in-person at a conference:</p>

<p>You are now spending your most precious resource, that most unrenewable commodity -- time, in order to listen and understand what I have to say.</p>

<p>Why do you do so? Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me--that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well. In turn, I'm willing to spend more time chatting with you for the same reason.</p>

<p>Why do we continue to chat, and not move on to other people to discuss with? Because as we chat we are exchanging a number of credentials -- people we know in common, common interests, meaningful ideas, etc. We may also present credentials typically issued by others, like our business cards, or explain our relationship to the host.</p>

<p>As our unspoken agreement to continue discussion evolves, we typically will unconsciously check to see if others are listening, and adapt our conversation thereafter. If the discussion becomes more personal or serious, we will often find ourselves moving to a more private portion of the room. As our discussions become deeper, we may begin to speak of things that hint at a mutual respect for confidentiality.</p>

<p>Also early on we'll begin to scope out the nature of our time together. Is it only professional, or a potential friendship? Even intimate relationships go through this phase -- are we with someone who wants to date? Is is possible that a future date lead to something more?</p>

<p>If we agree to meet later to discuss more, before we meet again we may go authenticate some of the credentials given us. We'll not authenticate all of them, only enough to substantiate the level of assurance that we need for the risk we are taking (which may only be the future loss due to wasted time, but even that is a form of risk.) This authentication can consist simply of confirming information given, or it can be as complex as asking for an endorsement from a mutual colleague.</p>

<p>As our collaboration grows, we will find ourselves seeking more and more credentials, endorsements, etc., but they will not be enough. The next level of trust can only be established by experience of commitment -- for instance do we call back when we said we would? These tests typically start with small things, and then grow to larger things. At some point this may ultimately grow to form simple verbal contracts; over time richer, deeper social contracts are agreed upon that might not be written down.</p>

<p>Ultimately we may bring in third parties to witness, and thus possibly enforce our mutual obligations, whether it is just having a mutual colleague view our handshake or friends see us kiss, or whether it is having a legal, signed document.</p>

<p>At some point our mutual interests may be so large that we decide not just to collaborate, but to share assets, whether through a partnership, a corporation, or a marriage. Before this is complete there will be more credentials and authentication of those credentials (talk to former employees, engage in credit checks, visit each others' families, take blood tests), endorsements, and less risky tests of the full contract (signing a term sheet, or a marriage engagement).</p>

<p>This is the way human trust works. It also very similar to the way that groups work -- a corporation will collaborate with another corporation in the same way, starting with small trust, going on to tests, and leading ultimately up to partnerships and mergers.</p>

<p>Computer trust rarely works the way that human trust does. It starts with mathematical proofs--that such and such a mathematical algorithm is extremely difficult, thus something built on it must also be difficult. These are then built on top of each other until a system is created. It often seeks a level of "perfect trust" that is rarely required by human trust.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I chose to back the then nascent SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Standard back in 1992-3, was that I felt that it much better mapped to the progressive trust model, and thus to human trust, then did its competitors.</p>

<p>At the time, the SET standard was backed by all the major players--Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft, etc. However, it not only required strong mutual authentication, but it also require multiple authentications. HTTPS was backed by RSA, required digital signatures, preferably by both parties. SSL was not necessarily a clear winner.</p>

<p>But SSL starts out very simple--first it just connects two parties, then it establishes simple confidentiality between them. If one party wants more confidentiality, they can upgrade to a stronger algorithm. Then one party can request a credential from the other, or both can. Either party has the option to request authentication of those credentials. Ultimately you could use SSL to come close to the level trust that SET tried to establish, but SSL isn't generally used that way because the market decided that only one party needed to send a credential--the merchant. SSL also proved to be more flexible then for use just with web pages or credit cards -- now it is used for things like securing email, creating VPNs, and playing online games.</p>

<p>Thus progressive trust is a useful conceptual model for understanding how trust might be built using online tools. Look at the tools that you are using now -- do they support various levels of trust, and a natural path between them? Or is trust more binary -- someone is only trusted, or not trusted. Are there implicit levels of progressive trust that are part of the culture of your group that might not embodied in the software itself?</p>

<p>Progressive trust also maps well to an user-interface design technique called <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProgressiveDisclosure>Progressive Disclosure</a>. It sequences information and actions across several different windows in order not overwhelm the user. You disclose basic information and choices first, then revealing progressively more complex information and choices. Thus you help the user manage the complexity of the application. Navigating group interactions and culture is also complex, thus progressive trust allows you to hide some of initial complexity of the trust model behind your tools, and thus lower barriers of entry to your software.</p>

				<p>This is not a political blog, but like most bloggers I've been indundated with various discussions about the Bush Administration, Michael Moore, Red vs. Blue, etc. So much so that on some professional email lists we've had to ask the participants to use the text "[POLITICS]" in their subject lines so that we can filter out the overt political content.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I tend not to participate in the political discussions is because most often they are polarizing. They tend to preach to the already converted, to harden the line, and often are too polemic. This was my problem with Farenheight 411 -- I thought there was some good stuff in the movie, but it was in a format that I didn't think would persuade the uncommitted. The first time the director used innuendo to oversell his points, and when he showed a lack of any respect for other points of view I think he lost the uncommitted audience.</p>

<p>Thus in general I've been reluctantly participating in the current political dialogue. I have contributed to various causes and campaigns, and have spoken to my friends about my thoughts on the subject, but I've not been bringing that activity online.</p>

<p><a href=http://sociate.com/blog/archives/2004_07_01_archive.html#109113435166448725><img src=../../images/BushArtSm.jpg alt=BushArtSm height=175 style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" border=0 width=140></a>However, I really do admire this statement on a t-shirt by <a href=http://sociate.com/>Jerry Michalski</a> <i>"Apparently half of you believe George W. Bush is an adequate president. I don't agree, and would love to talk about it respectfully"</i>.  I like it because because it clearly states the respect that is needed regarding the issues that the other half believe in. You may not agree with those issues, but you will be respectful to the person that believes them. Jerry has made this t-shirt available at <a href=http://www.cafeshops.com/sociate.12621018>Cafe Press</a>.<a href=../../images/jont.html onclick="window.open('http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/jont.html','popup','width=304,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/jont-thumb.jpg alt=jont height=157 style="float: right; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" border=0 width=100></a></p>

<p>Not quite as respectful, but done with conviction is a song by UK artist <a href=http://www.waragainstsleep.com/>Jont</a> that I like called <a href=http://www.yi-tan.com/mp3s/Jont-WorldGoneBlind.mp3>World Gone Blind (MP3 format)</a>, and is freely distributable under a Creative Commons' Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivitives License. I first heard him play at one of Jerry's Retreats. The song is very hip and elegant.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>In my <a href=../../2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html>review</a> last January of the amazing <a href=http://www.les7doigtsdelamain.com/menu.html>Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a> I talk about why I like circuses that are more raw and intimate, i.e. more "human" then the pretentious and distancing style of <a href=http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/default.htm>Cirque du Soleil</a>. However, I was disappointed that I saw the near-to-last show, so could not send my friends out to go see one of the great performances of the year.</p>

<p>Last night at the recommendation of <a href=http://finnern.com/2004/07/31.html#a714>Mark Finnern</a> I went to see <a href=http://www.circuscontraption.com/>Circus Contraption</a>, a marvelous burlesque-style musical comedy circus at the very intimate setting of the <a href=http://www.cellspace.org/>CELLspace</a> warehouse in San Francisco's Mission district. I arrived early and was able to grab a couch up front to view from (ala the Red Vic or Parkway Speakeasy movie theatres). </p>

<p>This year's show is "Grand American Traveling Dime Museum" which is particularly appropriate theme given the re-opening this month of the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/01/PKGHI7U19K1.DTL">Musee Mechanique</a> on Fisherman's Wharf. The show plays at 9pm every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in August except for August 15th and August 29th, and is only $15!</p>

<p><a href=../../images/circus_contraption_1.html onclick="window.open('http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/circus_contraption_1.html','popup','width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/circus_contraption_1-thumb.jpg alt=circus_contraption_1 height=75 style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" border=0 width=100></a></p>

<p>The troupe consisted of twelve players, who performed almost two dozen acts (with an intermission in the middle) that ranged from clownwork, trapeze, ropework, tumbling, acrobatics, juggling, skits, stilts, puppets, etc., all set to music. What makes Circus Contraption truly unique is the risque nature of the acts, and the raunchy exuberance of the music numbers. With the Pickles Family Circus and Seven Fingers there is often a subtext of eroticism and sensuality, but as these are family shows these themes are not overt. Circus Contraption is quite overt and fun -- definitely rated R stuff.</p>

<p>I'd not put the athletic complexity of the circus acts up there with Seven Fingers or Cirque du Soleil, but that is also part of what makes them so fun. I particularly liked that most of the cast participated as musicians, clowns, and performers at different points of the show, giving a dynamism to the troupe -- you never knew who was going to do what. This also gave some authentic amateurism to the show ('amateur' meaning 'to love') that was delightful.</p>

<p>The musicianship of the troupe was superior (<a href=http://www.circuscontraption.com/audio/come2circus.mp3>sample</a>), and was up there with the great acts. I picked up a CD when I left and listened to it on the way home and it was a quality treat. The band is also playing on Monday's this month at "The Odeon" bar at 3223 Mission (at Valencia).</p>

<p>So if you are in the SF Bay Area this month, go run and get yourself a <a href=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/398>ticket</a>. I hope to go again on August 27th.</p>
