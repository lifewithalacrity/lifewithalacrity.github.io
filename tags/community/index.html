<div class="p-summary">(by Christopher Allen with Elyn Andersson and Shannon Appelcline) Two years ago, the Bainbridge Graduate Institute (www.BGI.edu) faculty gathered to radically reinvent their sustainable business curriculum for the next decade. Our goal was not only to update course content, but also to significantly update how the material was taught. We wished to make our teaching process (our pedagogy) more interactive and also more effective for students graduating into a 21st-century work environment, where people increasingly work in teams-both online and offline.</div>

<div class="p-summary">We often think of communities as organic creatures, which come into existence and grow on their own. However, the truth is they are fragile blossoms.

If a community is too small you'll often have insufficient critical mass to sustain it.</div>
