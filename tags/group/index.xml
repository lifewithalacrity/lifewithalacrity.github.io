      <description>I was musing as I was preparing for next week&amp;#39;s Intensive at BGI that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That&amp;#39;s because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.
I talk about this a bit in my Group Threshold and Dunbar Number posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the&amp;#0160;“Judas Number” nadir, or low point.</description>

      <description>I have been leading the design of a new Open Source collaboration tool called EditThisPagePHP, which started six months ago and now is in beta.
My goal with EditThisPagePHP attempt to come close to Dave Winer&#39;s visionary statement back in May of 1999:
When I&#39;m writing for the web, and I&#39;m browsing my own site, every bit of text that I create has a button that says Edit This Page when I view it.</description>
