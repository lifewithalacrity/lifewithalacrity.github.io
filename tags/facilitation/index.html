<div class="p-summary">I was musing as I was preparing for next week&#39;s Intensive at BGI that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That&#39;s because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups. I talk about this a bit in my Group Threshold and Dunbar Number posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the&#0160;“Judas Number” nadir, or low point.</div>

<div class="p-summary">Shannon Appelcline, my colleague at Skotos (an online game company that I founded in 1999), has been writing for several years a sometimes weekly, sometimes bi-weekly column on the topic of game design called Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities (rss feed for all Skotos Articles including TT&amp;T). His latest column Social Software &amp; Gaming: User Content discusses issues of user content and user facilitation that apply both online game communities and social software: ...the more user content that we allow into games, the more troubles we have separating the good from the bad, the signal from the noise.</div>
