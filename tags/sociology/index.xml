      <title>Flames: Emotional Amplification of Text</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Cycle_of_flames&#34; title=&#34;Cycle_of_flames&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/photos/uncategorized/cycle_of_flames.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;
I&#39;ve been a moderator/host/forum leader for various bulletin boards and other online communities since the early 1980s; first on CompuServe, later on GEnie and AOL, and then professionally in the early days of Consensus Development. One of the behaviors that happens in online communities and that I rarely see elsewhere is flaming -- where one member writes an extremely inappropriate, typically passionately worded attack on another. Flaming behavior can hurt an online community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internet-guide.co.uk/email-flame.html&#34;&gt;commonly thought&lt;/a&gt; that flames occur because &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;there is very little proper policing done on the Internet&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; but I believe this to be false. Instead, I believe that it is the consequence of the medium primarily existing as text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, what you&#39;ll observe if you study individual flames is that they typically start as an escalation of emotion, only spiraling later into passionate and personal arguments. The only way to stop flames from destroying a community is to break this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve taught all my staffers over the years my ideas on what causes the cycle of flames, and how to avoid them. One particular piece of advice that I give is in regards to how emotions are amplified in the online text medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens for several different reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since text is lacking tonal and
visual context, we have a tendency to over-interpret any emotional
content that does exist (&lt;a href=&#34;http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1589611/0&#34;&gt;link to paper)&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we may have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70179-0.html?tw=wn_index_2&#34;&gt;no better than a random chance of correctly interpreting the emotional tone&lt;/a&gt; of ironic vs sincere text in a message (&lt;a href=&#34;http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/nicholas.epley/EpleyKruger.pdf&#34;&gt;link to Epley/Kruger paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we tend to respond to someone&#39;s emotional state by expressions of similar intensity (this phenomenon is known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521449480/202-9000930-0565465&#34;&gt;Emotional Contagion&lt;/a&gt;). And the higher the level of intensity of our emotions, the less our ability to be empathetic (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;list_uids=8436029&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract&#34;&gt;link to paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tendencies lead into a vicious feedback cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One person starts with a very trivial or subtle emotional context, say irony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is interpreted at a higher level of emotions, such as sarcasm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reply is made at a similar level of emotion, for example being sarcastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This, in turn, is interpreted at an even higher level of emotion, maybe a mild insult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In turn this is replied to at a similarly intense level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A flame is born!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I now find that now there are certain words and phrases that I avoid using when responding to people online. I have to be very careful with irony and sarcasm, and when I use them I include symbols such as smilies to such give the emotional context that is missing from the text. I find that even the slightest hint of blame will be over-interpreted. I avoid the words &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;didn&#39;t&amp;quot;, never tell someone that they forgot something, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My online community staffers have found understanding this cycle an important tool in moderating the communities they lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Interesting blog entry at http://joshreads.com/?p=518 on the use of quotation marks in cartoons to denote irony. Of course, this conflicts with using quotes for quotes, quotes for emphasis, and quotes for calling attention to a phrase â€” all common uses of quotes in text. No wonder we can&#39;t interpret irony accurately.

http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/introducing_the_troll_cap.php
Kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it almost points the way to a Microformat. Combined with a single log-on identity, being repetitively called out by one&#39;s peers as a disruptor of peace could begin to have actual consequences to one&#39;s online life ourside of one particular community or another.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Thanks for posting this, and for pointing out it&#39;s significance on a blogpost I sent up earlier today [1].  The seminal (I assume) Eply/Kruger paper, tho well beyone my abilities to fully assimilate, was certainly educational!

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Thanks for the visit Mr. Allen.  Something that at times helps in online forums is the use of emoticons.  They can be very helpful at steering conversations into the &#34;humor&#34; side of things.  (The use of quotations was purely intentional and trying to convey not just irony but also sarcasm.)

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;It&#39;s funny because I think most people understand intuitively that the written word is limited for conveying tone, at least in practical terms. Yet, it is easy for the most mundane online conversations to devolve into flamewars. I think part of it, too, is that people overestimate their ability to overcome any disagreement by continued conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I find this analysis of flaming very interesting, but did not find the approach I take, so let me describe this one. Flaming, from a social psychological point of view, is a force released from the group through the individual. Compare it to the experiment on Jewish girls whose blood-pressure was taken, while casually remarking that &#34;Jewish girls could handle less pain&#34; seemingly unrelated to the action taking place. This significantly caused these girls to allow much more pain infliction. Or the athlete who runs faster when he passes the cheering fans: he feels one of them and the best of them at that time. Flaming occurs when a group is aiming for the power to steer the whole group and not just themselves. This is particularly dangerous to democracy at whichever scale you look for it: the individuals seemingly each have their private conviction and these &#39;accidentally&#39; add up to become a strong democratic force. However, like we have seen in the Hamas election, the aim might as well be to be strong as a group and not care about the individual idea, as long as power (flaming) is the result. This is mimecry, studied for a lifetime by French philosopher RenÃ© Girard. It explains how societies evolve and postpone aggression, towards the scapegoat. In the end, it is exactly the way the judeo-christian society arose and how islam is now invading EU.

&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;&#34;Trolling&#34; is a relatively new cultural concept and not enough analysis has been done historically to distinguish the disruption of &#34;trolling&#34; from the legitimate act of dissent against group-think. Many forums royals wield the club of labeling others as &#34;trolls&#34; to enforce group-think. A persistence of dissent against a group is just persistence of dissent, it&#39;s ok, it&#39;s not necessarily &#34;disruptive,&#34; and suppressing such dissent in the name of some imagined Internet social harmony merely leads to stagnation and insularity. Where is the fresh perspective supposed to come from?
Re: &#34;One person starts with a very trivial or subtle emotional context, say irony.&#34;
Well, stop right there. By creating this cascade that leads to a flame, it appears as if you&#39;re absolving the original poster in some fashion. Why is it ok for him to be ironical? It&#39;s true that there is an acceleration and amplification of emotion, and others &#34;overract&#34; or &#34;take it out of proportion&#34; -- but is the blame for the flame them only on the shoulders of all those reacting? Why does the OP get a pass?
Certain forums are so poisoned by bad faith, unevenly moderated, and completely held hostage by group-think that no newcomer, or even veteran with good faith, can look at the ironical any more and take them merely as &#34;trivial&#34; or &#34;subtle&#34;. They create the tiny tinder and others light the match; why are they not made responsible for their tinder?

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;WHY YOU DIRTY S.O.B! HOW DARE YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT FLAMING!...
That is what I expected to see in the comments section. Of course your readers are far too sophisticated to go for the easy joke...
One of the things that has been shown is how much of communication is conveyed by facial expression and body language. That doesn&#39;t even touch the range you have with vocal inflection, volume and pacing.
If I don&#39;t see any feedback from my comment, I can&#39;t instantly correct myself. I can&#39;t see the look on the person&#39;s face to know that they don&#39;t get I&#39;m being sarcastic.
I&#39;m going to be working with two people next week who have problems with monotone delivery. This is especially difficult because they will be doing most of these presentations over the phone.
To &#34;amp up&#34; the level of information to deal with the loss of visuals, I&#39;m suggesting they do a few mechanical things (like marking the text to remind them to pause or moving to a more descriptive narrative of events so that the audience can follow along in their heads)
When you get to text, you lose the information you can get from the voice. Unless that is replaced somehow (like  with smiley faces as you mentioned) people can misinterpet.
So for people using text they sometimes need to be explicit in ways that is not necessary with face to face, video or audio communications.
One other thing with flames, I&#39;ll never forget the first time I had a meeting with someone who had flamed me not knowing who I was or that he would ever met me. He was very nice in person and it surprised me that the flames came from him. No doubt the social mores kicked in that say you don&#39;t scream &#34;WHO IS THIS IDIOT WHO DOESN&#39;T KNOW WHAT COPYRIGHT IS! SHIT HE EVEN SPELLS IT COPYWRITE!&#34; in real life, but you can do it on email.
Finally, here is another thing to add to the flame game mix. Did you ever notice that when you are reading something written by someone you know and you realise you are &#34;hearing&#34; them say it in your head while you are reading it? Because you know them and their pacing and style you can more easily detect something that is sarcastic that they have written because you can &#34;hear&#34; them saying that in your head.
With anonymous people you don&#39;t know that until you get to know them better, either in person or over a period of time reading them and responding to them.
Once again an excellent post and I expect that six months from now this will be the new topic in the news, &#34;Who is flaming me, and why?&#34;
That&#39;s our Mr. A, Always six months ahead of the curve!

      <title>Intimacy Gradient and Other Lessons from Architecture</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/intimacy_gradie.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2004 16:56:26 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/intimacy_gradie.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of my posts have been about integrating different domains of knowledge in order to better understand how human behavior should be incorporated in the design of social software. I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;The Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; in sociology, and both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/04/four_kinds_of_p.html&#34;&gt;Four Kinds of Privacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/progressive_tru.html&#34;&gt;Progressive Trust&lt;/a&gt; come from my work in the cryptography field. The topic of this post comes from the field of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/progressive_tru.html&#34;&gt;Progressive Trust&lt;/a&gt;, you need to establish what is known as an &#34;Intimacy Gradient&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Intimacy Gradient comes from architect Christopher Alexander, in his book &lt;a href=&#34;http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/&#34;&gt;A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. (Oxford University Press, 1977)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn127.html&#34;&gt;Pattern #127 - Intimacy Gradient:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conflict:&lt;/b&gt; Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence which corresponds to their degrees of privateness, the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family, will always be a little awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resolution:&lt;/b&gt; Lay out the spaces of a building so that they create a sequence which begins with the entrance and the most public parts of the building, then leads into the slightly more private areas, and finally to the most private domains.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In architecture there are always some areas of the house or building that are more public -- the entry, the living room, the atrium, etc., and areas that are more private such as bathrooms, bedrooms, and offices. In a good design there is some marker of change between these different areas -- it might be a difference in ceiling height, a stairway leading to a different floor, or a narrow entrance. As an example, in the classical Japanese tea house, you have to bow low before entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to respect the Intimacy Gradient results in uncomfortable buildings. &lt;a href=&#34;http://munnecke.com/gehry.htm&#34;&gt;Tom Munnecke&lt;/a&gt; reported about a Frank Gehry building at Case Western Reserve University:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; I asked many of the graduate students how they felt about their new environment. &#34;Horrible,&#34; said one. &#34;Like living in a refrigerator&#34; said another. &#34;We used to have comfortable offices and gathering places, and had the most wonderful conversations. Now everything is so sterile, and the acoustics so bad, that we can&#39;t do anything together. I have to go outside if I want any privacy.&#34;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intimacy Gradient is also used in other media. As I noted in my review of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html&#34;&gt;Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When we arrived, we were led down the side of the theatre and all of a sudden I noticed that it looked like we were all being led backstage. We curve around and all of a sudden see an entrance -- maybe 5 foot tall requiring most of us to duck. We duck through and to our surprise, we are have walked through a fridgerator, and we are on the stage!
&lt;p&gt;One of the 7 players welcomes us, and another offers random people a glass of tea as we walk across the stage to our seats. The stage is set like a city loft, with a tv, some couches, a bed, a bathtub and shower, a kitchen, and of course the fridgerator we entered through. On the stage, and chatting to members of the audience are the 7 cast members, all wearing comfortable looking white shorts or athletic and white t-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience arrives over 30 minutes and the 7 players act as if we are guests of their loft, serving some of us tea, chatting, sweeping the floor, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering through the refrigerator door raised the intimacy of the experience for the audience of that circus. Thus in spite of it being produced in a large auditorium it felt as up-close and personal as did the much smaller &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/circus_contrapt.html&#34;&gt;Circus Contraption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intimacy Gradient exists in movies as well -- anywhere you see a scene taking place in a public space that transitions down through smaller and tighter shots ultimately to a closeup of a face it is much more intimate then just cutting to the closeup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In social software design, there also needs to be an Intimacy Gradient. One of the problems with Wikis is that there is often very little transition between public and intimate, and doing so can be quite jarring. SocialText, a Wiki service vendor, is aware of this problem and is &lt;a href=&#34;http://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001393.html&#34;&gt;&#34;seeking to add more layers to the &#39;intimacy gradient&#39;, without recreating the highly structured collaboration tools that exist today&#34;&lt;/a&gt;. Ross Mayfield outlines &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/12/collaboration_cases_and_spaces.php&#34;&gt;this possible future Intimacy Gradient for SocialText&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The broadest tier is a guest space, available to all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second tier is a knowledgebase, accessible to all employees and contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third tier is product development, for employees and contractors bound by a confidentiality agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth tier is for the core management team to share confidential financial and HR information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These thoughts from an earlier post by &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt; are also thoughtful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He is right that groupthink is avoided by a social network structure that allows a dynamic and diverse periphery to provide new ideas, but the core of the network needs to be tightly bound to be able to take action.
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the main point of Building Sustainable Communities through Network Building by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.orgnet.com&#34;&gt;Valdis Krebs&lt;/a&gt; and June Holley. When studying a &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/categories/socialNetworks/2003/01/07.html&#34;&gt;community over time&lt;/a&gt;, they suggest a vibrant community is made up of four stages: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scattered Clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single Hub-and-Spoke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-Hub Small-World Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core/Periphery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal core/periphery structure affords a densely linked core and a dynamic periphery. One pattern for social software that supports this is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P127.htm&#34;&gt;intimacy gradient&lt;/a&gt; (privacy/openness), to allow the core some privacy for backchannelling. But this requires ridiculously easy group forming, as the more hardened the space the more hard-nosed its occupants become.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just a problem for Wiki. There is an excellent paper on the web called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ai.mit.edu/~konrad/docs/IJMMS-patterns-junestrand-keijer-tollmar.pdf&#34;&gt;Design Patterns for Private and Public Digital Spaces in the Home Environment&lt;/a&gt; where they explore how people used VNC (video-mediated communications, or more colloquially video-chat). They state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The earlier &#34;public&#34; character of a traditional farmer&#39;s house or bourgeois flat (in Sweden) has disappeared with the modern housing planning. Instead, distinguishing the public from the private has become central during the industrial age, with the dwelling as an exclusively private place. Now, with the transition to an information society, it seems as if the concept of public space in the private dwelling has to be reconsidered, which also means that the borders between the private and the public at home have to be opened up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to provide for an Intimacy Gradient in social software is clear; however, the techniques for showing the transitions between the gradients are not. For instance, in the original Netscape Communicator, when you connected with a secure SSL connection, the border around the edge of the window would turn blue, and a solid blue key would show up. However, most people didn&#39;t notice this change and no current browser does this; even the little locked icon at the bottom of Internet Explorer and often isn&#39;t visible if you have the status bar turned off or if you are using frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001289.htm&#34;&gt;Flemming Funch&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redtailcanyon.com/items/278391.aspx&#34;&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt;) notes part of the difficulty is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As long as a certain chat room or Wiki page is accessible directly with a deep link, it is going to be very hard to make it feel more intimate than any other place I can reach with similar ease. So a hierarchical structure of links doesn&#39;t do it. On the web you can&#39;t force people to accept your hierarchy if it is all just links.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the solution might come from the architecture world as well -- here are some other Patterns by Christopher Alexander (see the link for Alexander&#39;s resolutions for each):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn31.html&#34;&gt;Pattern #31 - Promenade:&lt;/a&gt; Each subculture needs a center for its public life: a place where you can go to see people, and to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn61.html&#34;&gt;Pattern #61 - Small Public Squares:&lt;/a&gt; A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public rooms, that a town has. but when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn69.html&#34;&gt;Pattern #69 - Public Outdoor Room:&lt;/a&gt; There are very few spots along the streets of modern towns and neighborhoods where people can hang out, comfortably, for hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn142.html&#34;&gt;Pattern #42 - Sequence of Sitting Spaces:&lt;/a&gt; Every corner of a building is a potential sitting space. But each sitting space has different needs for comfort and enclosure according to its position in the intimacy gradient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn147.html&#34;&gt;Pattern #147 - Communal Eating&#34;:&lt;/a&gt; Without communal eating, no human group can hold together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other lessons for social software from the architecture world are the concepts of &#34;refuge and prospect&#34;, the &#34;savanna theory&#34;, and &#34;defensible space&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Refuge and prospect&lt;/i&gt; come from the landscape architect &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.landscaperesearch.org.uk/extra31/refuge.htm&#34;&gt;Jay Appleton&lt;/a&gt;. Prospect is a place where we can see others, and refuge is a place were we can retreat and conceal ourselves. A specific prediction of his theory is that people prefer the edges of a space more then the middle. Often prospect and refuge are in conflict, as a prospect tends to be expansive and bright whereas a refuge is small and dark, but there are cases where they are combined in one place; this is why we value private homes with a spectacular view so much, and why we pay so much to stay at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.djc.com/news/ae/11127729.html&#34;&gt;scenic retreats&lt;/a&gt;. So what are the edges of our social spaces? Are there ways that we can signal either prospect and refuge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;savanna theory&lt;/i&gt; comes from a hypothesis by &lt;a href=&#34;http://notes.utk.edu/bio/greenberg.nsf/0/f60081ef35fba95c85256e6e006a2a77?OpenDocument&#34;&gt;Richard Coss and Gordon Orians&lt;/a&gt; that we should be most comfortable with those landscapes where humans spent most of their evolutionary past. Thus supposedly the ideal landscape design has the same proportionality of trees, grass, and brush as the African savanna; parks and golf clubs are shown as evidence of this theory. An alternate to this theory is that we desire a certain amount of &lt;a href=&#34;http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/institutes/urbanethology/student/html/erich/synekpro.html&#34;&gt;visual complexity&lt;/a&gt;. Either theory raises this question: what are the evolutionary markers regarding groups that our human ancestors needed? This question fits well with my thoughts regarding the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;defensible space&lt;/i&gt; concept comes from the idea that anonymous spaces lead to problems because of vandalism, incivility, and crime, and to eliminate those problems requires the residents to mark their &#34;territories&#34; and &#34;take possession&#34; of their areas. We have similar problems in the online world. So maybe the answer is similar -- allow more ways for groups of people to mark up and take possession of their own virtual spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of links that integrate these ideas in architecture that you might find useful:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still breaking ground and exploring new ideas in the world of social software. However, there are already extant fields of study which may give us insight into this new venue. Architecture is one of them. By better understanding ideas of intimacy gradients, pattern language, refuge and prospect, savannas, and defensible spaces, we may gain new understandings of how to build social environments which are attractive and enjoyable to more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Tried to post this elsewhere and failed. Sorry if it&#39;s duplication.
If a person loading a page has an identity or role (one could have many of these for different purposes) then the system serving the page could show different sets of links based on the &#34;privacy level&#34;. Of course, one could show entirely different sets of links to different people. This du(multi?)plicity would also reflect the method commonly employed in social manipulation, i.e. saying different things to different people based on one&#39;s view of them.
As it stands, this suggests that the person providing the link sets owns the server, which is often not the case.  Alternatively, it suggests that one is happy to trust a service provider with one&#39;s most intimate secrets.  I suspect neither needs to be the case if cryptography is used.

The fridge door speaks to another one of the Pattern Language patterns -- that a doorway should truly be a noticable, transforming experience. That is, a clear indicator that you have gone from &#34;there&#34; to &#34;here.&#34; Off-topic, I know. But interesting.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Thanks for the great summary and roundup of key concepts, theories and techniques from architecture and urban planning that can be applied to social software design.  I&#39;m also a big fan of these fields and I think we can stand to have a lot more cross-pollination between the worlds of software, and of space/place design.
As for how to simulate intimacy gradients, and more basic, &#34;hardwired&#34; ways that we behave in spaces and places, in the online world (or how to symbolize or substitute for them), I wonder:  Why don&#39;t we cheat more often?
People use our software in spaces and places, after all.  Instead of trying to -simulate- the physical, real-world intimacy mechanisms that we&#39;ve evolved to use, why not just -use- those physical mechanisms and context cues that already exist?  Why not design software that&#39;s aware of the very different places we move through?  Why not design software and devices tied to places?  That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do in a few very specific ways with PlaceSite.com, but there&#39;s so much more that can be done here.
