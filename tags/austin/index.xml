      <description>While I&#39;ve been out attending the SXSW Music, Movie and Interactive Conference there has been a flurry of high-quality postings about Social Networking.
Unlike many of my fellow bloggers, I find it difficult to post meaningful blogs while I&#39;m on the road. It has been my policy in my own blog postings to also be &#34;high-signal, low-noise&#34;, so normally I don&#39;t just post links without solid additional commentary, however, I&#39;m making an exception this time because of the quality and depth of these entries.</description>
