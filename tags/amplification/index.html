<h2><a class="p-name u-url" href='https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2006/02/flames_emotiona.html'> Flames: Emotional Amplification of Text</a> </h2>
<div class="post-meta"> <time class="dt-published" datetime="2006-02-13 13:07:32 -0700 -0700">February 13 2006</time> - 1900 Words </div>

<div class="p-summary">I've been a moderator/host/forum leader for various bulletin boards and other online communities since the early 1980s; first on CompuServe, later on GEnie and AOL, and then professionally in the early days of Consensus Development. One of the behaviors that happens in online communities and that I rarely see elsewhere is flaming -- where one member writes an extremely inappropriate, typically passionately worded attack on another. Flaming behavior can hurt an online community.</div>

<h2><a class="p-name u-url" href='https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html'> Dunbar Triage: Too Many Connections</a> </h2>
<div class="post-meta"> <time class="dt-published" datetime="2005-02-03 15:05:50 -0700 -0700">February 3 2005</time> - 4800 Words </div>

<div class="p-summary">As someone who now has over 171 professional &quot;connections&quot; in my LinkedIn Profile, 198 &quot;friends&quot; on Orkut, many more non-intersecting friends and acquaintances on&nbsp; &nbsp;Tribe.Net, LiveJournal, and other social networking services, as well as a plethora of correspondents that I only interact with via email, I am trying reconcile a mismatch between my connections and my own Dunbar Number. How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people? Venture Capitalist Jeff Nolan relates similar concerns: &quot;It strikes me that the social networking theory holds that the more volume you have, the bigger your network will become by introducing degrees of separation roughly along the lines of Metcalfe's Law.</div>
