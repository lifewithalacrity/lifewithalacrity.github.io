      <description>Today is Blog Action Day, where each year a topic is chosen and bloggers and activists worldwide write about that topic in their blogs or post about it on Twitter and Facebook using the tags #FOOD and&amp;#0160;#BAD11.
This year&amp;#39;s topic is Food, and this year many of my students of my BGIedu class Using the Social Web for Social Change&amp;#0160;are using the day to help kick off their &amp;quot;Beat Blog&amp;quot; assignments.</description>

      <description>Starting next week I will be teaching a course at the Bainbridge Graduate Institute on the topic of &amp;quot;Using the Social Web for Social Change&amp;quot;.

BGI offers an MBA and Certificate program for professionals to learn how to build enterprises that are financially successful, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. Students have to learn everything that they&amp;#39;d have to learn in an ordinary MBA program — profit and loss, how to read a balance sheet, business plan creation, macroeconomics, quantitative analysis, corporate strategy, how to manage and motivate people, and a basic understanding of all the components of business such as operations, marketing, distribution, sales, etc.</description>
