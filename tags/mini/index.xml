      <description>Between the business of the March/April conference season and leaving Blackphone, I&#39;ve run out of business cards. Rather than rush to print a bunch of new ones, I&#39;m created this mini-resume for digital sharing and a two-sided Avery business card version that I am printing on my laser printer and sharing.
Not as pretty as my old Life With Alacrity cards, but effective in getting across the diversity of my professional experience and interests.</description>
