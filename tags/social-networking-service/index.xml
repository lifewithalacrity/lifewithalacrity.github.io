      <description>As I&#39;m studying social network software right now, I consider it my job to try many of the hundred some odd social networks out there right now.
I just joined Zero Degrees, and like many others, it asked me to upload my address book. I&#39;ve done this before and usually it just finds those who already have joined these networks and links us together. Typically I delete my address book at this point, and don&#39;t bother to invite contacts that are not already members of that particular network.</description>
