      <description>In my first article&amp;#0160;in this series I talked about community numbers: how the sizes of groups ultimately affect their success (or failure). However what I discussed only offers up the most rudimentary explanation of the dynamics, and that is because typically not all of the members of a group are equally involved.
In order to better define who constitutes the tightly-knit &amp;quot;participant community&amp;quot; upon which the group thresholds act, we have to study power laws which let us measure the intensity of individuals&amp;#39; involvement in a group.</description>
