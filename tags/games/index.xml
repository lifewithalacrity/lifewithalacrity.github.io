      <title>iPhoneDevCamp and Hack-a-Thon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/atow/750701139/&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;133&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2007/07/08/everyone.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Everyone&#34; alt=&#34;Everyone&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I feel privileged and honored to have been part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp&#34;&gt;iPhoneDevCamp&lt;/a&gt; this last weekend. Over 380 iPhone developers came out to the Adobe Campus in San Francisco to help each other make the best possible web pages and webapps for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the keynote speaker on Saturday and Master of Ceremonies for the MacHack-style &lt;a href=&#34;http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCampHackAThon&#34;&gt;Hack-a-Thon Demo&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Hack-a-Thon almost 50 iPhone web applications were demonstrated to an enthusiastic audience. Take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xeodesign.com/tilt&#34;&gt;Tilt&lt;/a&gt;, a game that takes advantage of the iPhone&#39;s motion sensor, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mxis.com/pickleview&#34;&gt;PickleView&lt;/a&gt;, which is a same-time live baseball game enhancer, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bartholo.com/devcamp/pool.html&#34;&gt;The Pool&lt;/a&gt;, an attractive social game of water droplets hitting a pool. What is remarkable about these applications is not just the quality, but that each of them was written over just the weekend by a small team of 3-4 people who hadn&#39;t met each other before Friday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/snackfight/750214294/&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2007/07/08/hewitt.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Hewitt&#34; alt=&#34;Hewitt&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Prizes were awarded after the Hack-a-Thon based on the spirit of openness, contribution, sharing, and participation. Prizes included 3 iPhones and some very expensive Adobe software. In particular &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joehewitt.com/&#34;&gt;Joe Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getfirebug.com/&#34;&gt;Firebug&lt;/a&gt; fame, was honored for his positive contributions, generous spirit, and wonderful iPhone UI &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joehewitt.com/files/iphone/navigation.html&#34;&gt;example code&lt;/a&gt;. During the demonstrations, more than one person praised Joe, saying that his assistance, his code, or his debugger made their apps possible. Personally, I think about one-third of the web apps presented used some of his code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on my experience with the same-time collaboration tool &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synchroedit.com&#34;&gt;SynchroEdit&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net&#34;&gt;Skotos&lt;/a&gt; web-based games, I worked remotely with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kallealm.com/&#34;&gt;Kalle&lt;/a&gt; from Sweden and &lt;a href=&#34;http://is-here.com/&#34;&gt;Erwin&lt;/a&gt; from Kansas to present an AJAX chat application called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/&#34;&gt;iLace&lt;/a&gt;. I am particularly proud of how well this little web application performs and how well it works using the iPhone UI. In particular, I think its melding of text entry and chat message receipt and its response to changes between portrait and landscape modes are very good examples of what can be done for chat on the iPhone. Source code is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/about.html&#34;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/atow/749665338/&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;133&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2007/07/08/keynote.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Keynote&#34; alt=&#34;Keynote&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My keynote presentation slides are now available in &lt;a href=&#34;http://iphonedevcamp.org/stuff/iPhoneDevCamp_Keynote.pdf&#34;&gt;.pdf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://iphonedevcamp.org/stuff/iPhoneDevCamp_Keynote.mov&#34;&gt;.mov&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m told a live recording of the session and an .mp3 will be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks an online developer community that I started at WWDC called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com&#34;&gt;iPhoneWebDev&lt;/a&gt; has grown to over 650 members. It&#39;s now the best place to get online support for building iPhone web pages and webapps. I&#39;d like to keep the momentum from the iPhoneDevCamp going forward on this list, so if you are interested in developing for the iPhone, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com/examples&#34;&gt;example code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iphonewebdev.com/&#34;&gt;join&lt;/a&gt; the discussion today!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ratings: Who Do You Trust?</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2006/09/ratings_who_do_.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2006 16:28:58 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2006/09/ratings_who_do_.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline.php&#34;&gt;Shannon Appelcline&lt;/a&gt;, has been working on a game rating system for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpg.net&#34;&gt;RPGnet&lt;/a&gt;. This has resulted in real-world application of the principles for designing rating systems which we&#39;ve previously discussed in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/collective_choi.html&#34;&gt;Collective Choice&lt;/a&gt; articles. Shannon&#39;s newest article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_196.phtml&#34;&gt;Ratings,
Who Do You Trust?&lt;/a&gt; offers a look at weighting ratings based on reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/shannon_appelcline.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Shannon_appelcline&#34; alt=&#34;Shannon_appelcline&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the &lt;a href=&#34;http://index.rpg.net/&#34;&gt;RPGnet Gaming Index&lt;/a&gt; we&#39;ve put this all together to form a tree of weighted ratings that answer the question, &lt;em&gt;who do you trust&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&#39;s how we measured each type of trust, and what we did about it:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume of Ratings for an Item.&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce a bayesian weight to offset the variability of items with low-volume ratings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume of Ratings by a User.&lt;/strong&gt; Give each user a weight based on his volume of contribution which is applied to his ratings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth of Content by a User.&lt;/strong&gt; Give each rating a weight based on the depth of thought implicit in the rating which is applied to that rating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These all get put together to create our final ratings for
the Gaming Index, with each user&#39;s individual rating for an item
getting multiplied by its user weight and its content weight, and then
all of that averaged with the other user ratings and the bayesian
weight too. The result is in no way intuitive, but users don&#39;t really
need to understand the back end of a rating system. Conversely we hope
it&#39;s accurate, or at least more accurate than would otherwise be true
given the relatively low volume of ratings we&#39;ve collected thus far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of Shannon&#39;s earlier discussions about the design behind the new &amp;quot;user content&amp;quot; based &lt;a href=&#34;http://index.rpg.net&#34;&gt;RPGnet Gaming Index&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

User Creativity&lt;/a&gt; - A look at the &amp;quot;XP&amp;quot; system which has helped to incentivize the creation of the database at the heart of the ratings.
&lt;/li&gt;

Hmm, interesting on the weighting system.
Can you explain with more detail how the rating by depth of content is generated?
I&#39;m looking through the other articles, so hopefully I find the info there.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;URL:
My first pass system just used a different multiplier for weight based on the type of content:
1x for just a raw rating
2x for a rating with a non-blank comment
5x for a review (which goes through a different, approved content system)
My second pass system also included &#34;volume of ratings by user&#34; and thus applied a variable multiplier depending on how many ratings the user has made:
(0-2x) for a raw rating
2x(0-2x) for a rating with comment
5x for a review
The 0-2x is calculated as (# of ratings by user)/50, to 2 max.
I&#39;m pretty sure that the core weighting system by depth is producing better results, though I haven&#39;t done any studies of that yet. The additional weighting for volume by users has definitely prevented bias by hit-and-run raters who just stop by to rate one game that they&#39;ve been asked to.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dunbar &amp; World of Warcraft</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2005 16:01:19 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my initial blog entry on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; I presented some statistics on group sizes based on the online game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uo.com&#34;&gt;Ultimata Online&lt;/a&gt;. In it you could clearly see the power-law (pareto) curve, with diminishing returns at around 150, with most groups being 60 in size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html#onlinecommunities&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;550&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/UOGuildPowerLaw.jpg&#34; width=&#34;814&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html#onlinecommunities&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;536&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/UOGuildHistogram.jpg&#34; width=&#34;829&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickyee.com/&#34;&gt;Nick Yee&lt;/a&gt; and other researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/&#34;&gt;PlayOn Blog&lt;/a&gt; have been researching the behaviors of players in the popular &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; online game. At my request, they sampled guild sizes over a one-week period, and prepared &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html&#34;&gt;similar graphs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060205115408/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html&#34;&gt;internet archive link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(&amp;#39;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;popup&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;width=925,height=348,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Guildsize&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b image-full img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-800wi&#34; title=&#34;Guildsize&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Guildsizehisto&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b image-full img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b-800wi&#34; title=&#34;Guildsizehisto&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these statistics still support my original hypothesis in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; post that mean group sizes will be smaller than 150 for non-survival oriented groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&amp;#39;t have requisite variety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the diminishing returns for large groups in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; appear to cut off much sooner then they do in &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt;, with the 95th percentile 54 and the 99th percentile being 110. When I asked about why the &amp;#39;knee&amp;#39; was much closer to 50 rather than &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;knee around 150, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.legendmud.org/raph/&#34;&gt;Raph Koster&lt;/a&gt; (the game designer who gave me the original &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; data) answered that it might be because &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; used a &amp;quot;veteran member&amp;quot; method of counting. This could result in under reporting of new users and thus pushing up sizes of more established groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also different was the fact that the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; guild sizes display a reverse power-law, with the smallest groups being much more common, rather then the bell curve of &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt;. If one-person guilds are excluded, the average guild size was 16.8, the median was 9. This seems to correspond much closer to my thoughts on a smaller &amp;#39;nodal&amp;#39; threshold for group size that I&amp;#39;ve observed at around 15, which I describe in &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that there is something about &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; such that even participating in very small groups can be useful, whereas for &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; the utility is gained mainly by sharing the resources earned by larger groups. Thus &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; has groups that are &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot;, while with &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; groups are more llikely to be just &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve not had time to play &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; yet, so I&amp;#39;m curious if those who have more experience would agree with my hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I play WoW on a regular basis, and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by the preponderance of small guilds, as the best high-end gear is available in instances that require raids involving large groups of high-level players (up to 40 people). In fact, this is an oft repeated complaint on the WoW forums: smaller guilds do not have access to this gear unless they can manage to form alliances with other small guilds.
However, for low and mid-level players, going through instances only requires 5-player groups, and instances are usually the best source for great gear at every level, so for those players who haven&#39;t reached level 60 yet, there is no immediate advantage to joining a large guild.
I would therefore be curious to see a correlation between player level and guild size.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I play WoW and I&#39;ve never played UO but I&#39;ve heard from many MMORPG veterans that WoW is far too kind in terms of its penalities for death. In fact, there&#39;s little penalty for death besides 10% damage to your equipment (easily repairable) and walking your spirit back your corpse. In other games, things like gold, items, rank and experience can be lost as a result of character death.
This could mean that there&#39;s simply less of a survival mentality amoungst players and groups are formed for rewards rather than for aversion of penalties.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I don&#39;t know about UO, but WoW features individualised gear. Certain gear, once &#34;owned,&#34; simply cannot be passed on to someone else. As such, in the earlier levels, it&#39;s possible that players not even bother to join a guild. It&#39;s entirely viable to solo up until the high level instances. There isn&#39;t as much dependence on grouping.
My opinion, of course. YMMV.

Some facts about WoW guild sizes:
What is the point of a guild with one member? Since the guild name is displayed with your character, then it is like a last name for your character ( a further way to show how clever you are) even a guild of one can have it&#39;s own guild tabard
Guild of less then 5: You can only have 2 professions so it is worthwhile to team up with others that you can trade goods with tailoring/enchanting mining/blacksmithing skinning/leather-working there is also mining/engineering but almost none of the stuff engineers make can be shared so for lower level character a group of 3 can be VERY helpful, also 3 is an easy to maintain group size and obviously the killing/questing goes much faster. This group falls apart for characters higher then 30 (for reason listed below)
Guilds of around 5+: Most instance dungeons must be done with 5 players, each with a role (tank, healer, damage, off-tank, off-healer), a 3 player guild will need 2 pick-up players.  Pick-up players, as a rule, are used to playing solo and don&#39;t stay in a role as well, leading to lots of problems.
Guilds of around 40+: High lvl dungeons need 40 players, so I think your results would look extremely different if you only showed lvl 50 or higher characters also blacksmithing splits into 2 specialties and leather-working splits into 3 specialties leading to larger group size.
Another thing that affects group size is &#34;alts&#34;, if I create a killer guild, I am going to want all my characters to belong to it, even if I don&#39;t play them anymore.  So by looking a just lvl50 or higher characters I think you would strip out a lot of &#34;alts&#34;, and that would give a better &#34;real&#34; group size
&lt;/p&gt;

WoW has taken a lot of steps to enable players to find players to group with, such as dedicated chat channels and a system allowing players to join a queue and be automatically placed in groups.  Also WoW is incredibly solo-friendly - you never need to group to get to level 60, and even some endgame content is accessible such as the PvP Battlegrounds.  The points already mentioned about the simple tradeskill structure and absence of tradeable &#39;hand-me-downs&#39; are crucial as well, so I&#39;m not too surprised you see a smaller average guild size.
If WoW incorporated a working formal alliance structure you might see it splinter even more.
On a more general note, if a guild is being formed for 40-person raids, only the hardest of the hardcore will actually have 40 players - they&#39;d want sufficient numbers to be able to routinely get 40 players of appropriate level and class distribution together.
My WoW guild has reached sizes where 40-person groups are sometimes possible spontaneously.  In my opinion we&#39;re skirting, and probably have crossed into, the &#39;too-large&#39; realm.  I find I&#39;m more likely to ignore guild chat, simply because there are so many people and things going on.  I also don&#39;t feel as close to guildmates - to the point of not recognizing some - which has never happened to me before.
I blame the game.  WoW owes much of it&#39;s success to being more casual friendly, and has a tendency to attract and even promote less social playstyles.  I notice my behavior is changed from past MMO&#39;s when I was perfectly happy to just chat for awhile.  In WoW everything is go, less (or no) downtime between fights, more interaction needed during battles (I most often play a rogue, which plays more like a FPS than anything else), less travel time, it all adds up to a game which is very fun, yes, but definatley less social.
P.S.  Anyone studied the effects of Teamspeak on optimal group/raid/guild sizes?

World of Warcraft is actually quite intricate in its workings. The style of play often changes with the level of the player&#39;s character(s). Also, the ruleset a person is playing on influences how they group and interact with people.
For instance, on the PvP servers, now that the majority of players have had high level characters for a while, practically no one does low-level instances. People are either busy in battlegrounds (BG&#39;s) or high level instances. So most people who aren&#39;t level 60 end up soloing or grouping with very few people. But a guild is ideal to have, as you can call people in for backup when enemy players are ganking you while levelling up. But this makes the size of these guilds rather arbitrary.
When a person reaches level 60 on the PvP servers, they tend to join a guild that participates in PvP fairly often. It doesn&#39;t require many people to PvP, as some BG&#39;s only allow 10 people. And those BG&#39;s that allow more are difficult to get into, so people only enter in small groups anyway. Even for the small BG&#39;s it can be difficult to enter the server with a predetermined group, due to the way the queueing system works. So the desire for small groups on PvP servers is high (as it is easier to enter the BG&#39;s). This can make some guilds fairly small.
It should be noted about the PvE ruleset that a lot of low-level players are able to participate in low-end 5-to-10-man dungeons (almost always done with 5), as the interest in fairly high amongst those levelling up alts and new players. So people new to this low-level content often join small guilds, or guilds with a vast number of low-level alts.
Now, when people participate in high-level dungeons, things are a little different. Really, there is only one high-level dungeon that is for five people. And there are a few high-level dungeons that allow for 10 or 15 people, but neither they nor the 5-man dungeon offer the best loot. This causes only casual players to really concentrate on that content.
Sometimes, a player will want to approach the game in a serious, hardcore manner, but because they can&#39;t handle large groups or are generally anti-social, they may end up staying in a smaller guild. I&#39;ve encountered three cases of this, all of which involved personal online gaming friends.
In terms of hardcore, high-level content, you have three 40-man dungeons (however, I&#39;d classify one of them as a simple encounter), one 20-man dungeon and two outdoor, 40-man encounters that offer the best loot. With the addition of the 20-man raid dungeon, I expect average guild sizes will fall slightly. But I&#39;m sure there will be plenty of guilds concentrating on the 40-man PvE content.
In order to do the complex 40-man raid dungeons, you need a guild that has at least 40 people that can play regularly, the right class setup, and backups to take the place of crucial missing pieces. However, I have often found that there are &#34;regulars&#34; that show up to almost every raid. This means the number of backups is usually relatively small.
This explanation is not very eloquent, I realize, but I hope it brings some insight into things. It&#39;s rather a subjective opinion, as well. I don&#39;t have numbers to back this up--it&#39;s all based on personal experience with both rulesets.
&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your open question as to whether World of Warcraft had some characteristics that caused it to trend towards lower guild sizes.
I&#39;ve been playing World of Warcraft since release. In short, your answer is &#34;yes&#34;.
Compared to other MMOs, World of Warcraft is different in significant respects. The level grind to cap (60) is -much- less intense than in comparable games. I believe that the average time to 60 in terms of days played is about 15 days and it can be much less for a veteran player.
WoW is very quest-oriented and a majority of quests are accomplishable solo. Quests usually fall into the typical categories of kill-quests, loot-quests, and Fedexes. If you want to level quickly, you do this by solo grinding and cherry-picking quests.
On the path to 60, WoW offers several instanced raid dungeons. On the alliance side, there&#39;s Deadmines, Stockades, Shadowfang Keep, Uldaman, Scarlet Monastery, Zul&#39;Farrak, Maraudon, Sunken Temple. These instances have some quests in them, but, in addition, they&#39;re participant-capped. No more than 5 grouped players can be in the instance parts of these dungeons.
This has the effect of allowing guilds with less than 5 regular people to successfully reach level cap as a social group.
Once a player reaches 60, however, things start to change. 60th level players very quickly exhaust the number of quests that are available to them. This leaves only the high-end instances to do:
Blackrock Depths
Stratholme
Scholomance
Blackrock Spire
Zul&#39;Gurub
Molten Core
The maximum number of players who can participate on these endgame instances increases dramatically. Blackrock Depths is limited to 5 participants. Strat and Scholo are 10, I think. Blackrock Spire is 15. Molten Core is 40. Zul&#39;Gurub is a new &#34;starter&#34; raid instance that requires 20.
Small guilds who make it to 60 often find that they are &#39;stranded&#39;, without enough critical mass to perform the higher level raid instances but without the connections to join with other guilds to participate in them. This abrupt transition of the gameplay at the end from casual to hardcore is a common player complaint.
Another factor that may lead to smaller guild sizes in the endgame compared to Ultima Online is that practically all raid content IS instanced. This means that to get the best loot, a guild needs to be able to muster only the raid-limit cap for that particular instance. In contrast, in Ultima Online, my understanding is that many of the end-game bosses are out &#39;in the open&#39; and on long spawns. This means that to achieve success, guilds in that game not only need to be able to muster enough players to defeat the raid encounter but must ALSO achieve enough mass in order to prevent other guilds from dominating the spawn. This becomes a sheer numbers game.
&lt;/p&gt;

While I have not played WOW, in EVE-online another MMPOG, the occurence of corporations smaller than 3 is usually because the members are subverting the rules.
samll corps exist so that people can play solo, outside of the normal social infrastructure. In dangerous areas the new player corps are normally Kill On Site, so experienced solo players create a corp for the small number of characters that individual person operates.
small corps exist so that you can declare war and blackmail other corps without your main corp suffering any fallback.
Or they serve as peoples murderous &#39;alt&#39; characters, again so that you can avoid any come back onto your main character or corp.
small corps exist so that they can create clones without needing to build high standing of your main corp (a sort of game exploit).
small corps exist to scam money out of people by creating fake lotteries etc
small corps exist so that an alt character can run a business away from the normal agreed rules of the corp that the main character is part of.
If similar things happen in other MMPOGs, it might be worth ignoring the small groups when drawing conclusions about social groups, they usually exist to either be explicitly anti-social or to subvert the game mechanics in some way.

      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2005 01:08:16 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/04/future_topics.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been working on an ambitious list of topics that I&#39;d like to cover over the next year. I offer them to you here so you can have some idea the areas that I am thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Office Architecture for Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- Over the years I&#39;ve built or converted three offices to my specifications. From this I have learned a number of things about about how to create a productive environment innovation-oriented businesses. These include some of the obvious suggestions such as fresh air and natural light, but also include not so obvious ideas such as using magnetic paint and providing a small washer-dryer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requisite Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- This concept from cybernetics applies to social systems as well. &amp;quot;The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate.&amp;quot; More people, as well as a diversity of thinking styles and experience, give social software more &amp;quot;variety of actions&amp;quot;, thus this is part of the reason why social software can be so effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art and Craft of Meme Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- We are learning more about how to create an effective meme. Creating memes has always been an art performed by publicists, marketers, politicians, the press, and to a lesser extent by scientists and other academics. Have we learned enough to turn this art into an explicit craft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wiki Editing Dichotomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the &amp;quot;wiki editing dichotomy&amp;quot;. You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don&#39;t know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choice &amp;amp; Neuroeconomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- There are some that say at the root of every decision is emotion. Even a &#39;rational&#39; decision appeals to a sense of balance or beauty. Recent studies using PET are establishing a neurological basis for emotions, and some reveal interesting facts about how we make choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessing Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- There are a variety of areas where we as humans have a difficult time being completely rational. One of these is risk assessment. It turns out we may be hard-wired to not be able toeasily understand risk that is greater then one in a hundred or so. Thus a very rare risk, say one in a thousand, will often be emotionally interpreted as having a much higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persuasive Computing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- BJ Fogg&#39;s group at Stanford has done some interesting research on how computers can persuade you to do something. There are a number of useful ideas that come from this research. There are also some ethical considerations that should be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive Dissonance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- This technique is central to many forms of persuasion intended to change beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors. It is used by facilitators, businesses, military organizations, and even cults. It can be used positively or negatively. How might it be used in social software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dark Side of the Force&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- The same social tools that we use for good, can also be used for harm. How do we ethically use what we are learning about social software? Some say that almost by definition social software attracts spammers, trolls, and innappropriate sexuality. What can we do to prevent these misuses of social software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conversation vs Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- Update and rewrite of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alacritymanagement.com/GCnC.html&#34;&gt;1990 essay&lt;/a&gt; on how social software design needs to balance conversation vs communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- We appear to have evolved a number of emotions that appear primarily to exist to support a common good, rather then to ensure our individual success. These include schadenfreude, mirth, naches, revenge, shame, pride, outrage, approbation, admiration, elevation, etc. Studies by Eckman on unconscious facial gestures, studies on the neurological basis for emotions, and studies on emotions in games, are proving that these social emotions exist. A number of them have interesting implications on social software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glances &amp;amp; Strokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- There is some old work on the amount of eye contact we make with others in small groups, as well as some research from transactional analysis on strokes, which are the amount of recognition given to others through words and deeds. Is there a neurological basis for needing a certain number of glances and strokes each day? How does this concept apply to social software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weak Links&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- There are some interesting social implications behind what we&#39;ve learned about weak links in social networks. How do we identify and encourage weak links in our social software systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Negativity vs Positivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- It is far easier for someone to respond negativel than positively. In political systems it is far easier to say no rather then yes. What social software encourages positivity, and is it possible to design social software to do so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Economy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- Our ultimate most unrenewable resource is time. How time and attention are a basic economic unit that should be considered when looking at social software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group Life Cycle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- We often focus on how groups form, emerge, and grow. Yet there are many lessons to be learned from how groups die, including that it isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing and that keeping a group from death can be dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Groupthink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- What causes groupthink? When is it good and when is it bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Thresholds in the Value of Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- In order for knowledge to be valuable, it must at minimum be more valuable then the costs to find and absorb it (costs which include bandwidth and attention). Tools like Google have tremendously increased the amount of knowledge that is worth the time and attention to find it. What types of knowledge fall below this threshold of value? Is there a limit to how much we can lower this line? Furthermore, there is another threshold where the knowledge is significantly more valuable than only bandwidth and attention. How much have internet tools impacted this second threshold? Many internet business models, in particular content models, require some ability to offer value in this upper threshold -- can they survive as this upper threshold changes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intimacy and Social Networks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- Social Networks Analysis tends to focus on the connections between people, either explicitly through acknowledgement of connections (LinkedIn, Friendster) or implicitly through analysis of your communication (Spoke). None are able to measure intimacy. Yet our intimate social networks are an important component of our overall happiness and contentment within both our professional and personal lives. How does intimacy work in social networks? Also there are some concepts in psychology known as communal vs exchange relationships by Clark &amp;amp; Mills from late 70&#39;s that may apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- A recap of Shannon Appelcline&#39;s and my analysis of the basic forms of social games types. These include relatively well understood ones like majority control, voting, meta-voting (Nomic), auctioning, etc., but also include less well understood games like playing of roles, dominance and submission, etc. There are also links to social emotions, such as mirth and schadenfraude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons from Castle Marrach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- We released the Castle Marrach online game in September of 2000, and it was designed from the beginning to be a game for the Bartle-type known as &amp;quot;the socializer&amp;quot;. What lessons did we learn in the five years since the release of the game? What tools are in my social software toolbox today that might have helped with the design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons from F2F Facilitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- There are many skilled practitioners of face-to-face facilitation, some of which are paid very high fees for their skills. What lessons can we learn from their experience that we can apply to social software? Why have so many of these facilitators failed to have success online?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;More Human vs More Than Human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- Many futurists seek to offer us augmentation of our minds and bodies through technology. Many of these ideas may fundamentally change what it is to be human, and may even have unforeseen complications unanticipated by their creators. One interesting approach to looking at these technologies is to examine which make us &amp;quot;more human&amp;quot;, rather then &amp;quot;more than human&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons from Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- Most, if not all, mental disorders have their roots in survival strategies; however, they are over-expressed because of genetic or other causes. Examining the healthy behaviors hiding behind depression, autism, mania, schizophrenia, paranoia, etc. offer a number of insights on how we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joy of being a Primate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- If you scan the surface of my writing, you may observe that I have a strong belief that our animal nature and genetics form an essential and often unconscious part of what it is to be human. You could interpret these &amp;quot;nature&amp;quot; over &amp;quot;nurture&amp;quot; ideas as limiting us to being just animals. Instead, I believe that by becoming aware of our primate nature, and choosing to leverage it or suppress it by conscious choice rather then letting it drive us unaware, is what makes us more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- Nick Szabo popularized the idea of using some of the primitives of cryptography in unique ways to create what he calls &amp;quot;smart contracts&amp;quot;. He hypothesized approaches to cryptographic handling of collateral, bonding, delineation of property, bearer certificates, and much more. Others have proposed various auction protocols using these concepts. One of the fundamental atomic elements of many of these smart contracts is something called a &amp;quot;reusable proof of work&amp;quot;, which Hal Finney recently demoed a version of at CodeCon 2005. What are the possibilities offered by smart contracts? What are the barriers to implementation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Club System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- In the 80&#39;s, development of Ted Nelson&#39;s Xanadu vision was being financed by Autodesk. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons Xanadu failed to deliver any technology. However, a couple of their ideas could be valuable today, one of which is the concept of an alternative to the &amp;quot;user and groups&amp;quot; metaphor for computer security. Xanadu turned that idea upside down and called the result the &amp;quot;club system&amp;quot;. The club system approach is particularly suited to the internet based collaboration tools, in particular wikis. I also have some insights to offer a cryptographic approach to the club system, which might allow P2P distribution of collaborative documents, while preserving group privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edges of Cryptographic Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- The SSL cryptographic protocol offers a choice of a number of security properties: integrity, confidentiality, encryption, one-party authentication, and two-party authentication. But there are a number of security properties that very few deployed cryptographic protocols offer. These include perfect forward secrecy, undeniability, deniability, authorization, delegation, multi-party authentication, shared secrets, etc. What are these security properties and how are they useful? Why have they not been successfully broadly deployed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SSL Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- When SSL was first proposed it was broken within an hour. Even when Netscape fixed those problems, it wasn&#39;t clear that SSL was going to win the battle of security protocols. SSL was competing against SHTTP which had backing of RSA and an industry consortium. The credit card companies merged their standards and were backing SET. The internet community was moving toward SSH. Microsoft was doing its own embrace and extend protocol PCT. So how did SSL win to become the broadest deployed cryptographic security protocol? The answers may surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;

several years a sometimes weekly, sometimes bi-weekly column on the
topic of game design called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_.shtml&#34;&gt;Trials, Triumphs &amp;amp; Trivialities&lt;/a&gt; (rss feed for all &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/index.xml&#34;&gt;Skotos Articles&lt;/a&gt; including TT&amp;amp;T).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His latest column &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_163.phtml&#34;&gt;Social Software &amp;amp; Gaming: User Content&lt;/a&gt; discusses issues of user content and user facilitation that apply both online game communities and social software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...the more user content that we allow into games, the more
troubles we have separating the good from the bad, the signal from the
noise. As we introduce user content systems into games, filtering it will become the next challenge. Fortunately there are already some answers in our nearby field of Social Software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I wrote about in an &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2003/12/socialization_i.html&#34;&gt;older post&lt;/a&gt;, Shannon has also written a number of interesting columns on the topic of designing social games:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Socialization in Online Games</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2003/12/socialization_i.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2003 04:32:03 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2003/12/socialization_i.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shannon Appelcline&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_.shtml&#34;&gt;&#34;Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities&#34;&lt;/a&gt; column in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/&#34;&gt;Skotos Articles section&lt;/a&gt; recently featured a trilogy of articles about stretching the bounds of socialization in online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_136.phtml&#34;&gt;Social Gaming Interactions, Part One: A History of Form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first article outlines the problem by looking out how social interaction has traditionally been handled in online games, and by considering how limiting these interactions typically have been. It also outlines how to expand traditional social interactions by describing three main categories of social interaction: competition, cooperation, and freeform.&lt;blockquote&gt;That the majority of MMORPGs, MUDs, and other multiplayer games ultimately support achiever players over socializers, or even killers, I think begins to outline how poorly we understand--and support--true social interactions in today&#39;s multiplayer games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_137.phtml&#34;&gt;Social Gaming, Part Two: Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second article expands upon the competitive category of social interaction. Besides touching upon traditional direct competition, it also considers resource competition, economic competition, and the role of bluffing in competition. A number of examples are drawn from tabletop board games.&lt;blockquote&gt;In looking at competitive interaction I intend to first consider some forms of competitive interaction that we&#39;ve sort of covered--direct competition and resource competition--but will show how even in these &#34;well known&#34; interactions we&#39;ve just scratched the surface. Afterward we&#39;ll get into some less explored possibilities: economic competition and bluffing. The end result? More variability in competition, more viability and for the players, ultimately, more fun.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_138.phtml&#34;&gt;Social Gaming Interactions, Part Three: Cooperation &amp; Freeform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final article expands upon the other two categories of social interaction: cooperation and freeform. Within cooperative interaction we find a spectrum of possibilities varied by the immediacy of the cooperators. Freeform interaction is given a more generalized overview, covering some of the reasons it appears and how to encourage it.&lt;blockquote&gt;In Richard Bartle&#39;s categorization of multiplayer gamers, he very broadly touches upon &#34;socializers&#34;--players who are there because they want to interact not just with the game system, but also with other people. I actually believe there&#39;s a lot more granularity to the category of socializers than just its simple name. The biggest subset of socializers is, I believe, the cooperative players--those who are working together within the game system toward a specific goal. A few different MMORPGs have tried to appeal to this group, but as with competitive gamers there&#39;s also more we can learn from the word of tabletop games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;My personal belief is that the so-called &#34;socializer MMPORGs&#34; -- Sims Online, There, Second Life, etc. -- have missed the boat by not really understanding the socializer, or treating them like they are achievers. If someone can figure out how to break out of that trap, there may be a new hugely successful MMPORG game opportunity available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve always enjoyed playing online games but I haven&#39;t ever thought of what I get from it except fun. Thanks for pointing out to me its other benefits.

      <title>Skotos and Social Software</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2003/12/skotos_and_soci.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2003 15:53:52 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2003/12/skotos_and_soci.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been interested for several years in the ability of &#34;player-generated content&#34; to create niche or small multiplayer online games, at a company I&#39;ve invested in called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net&#34;&gt;Skotos &lt;/a&gt;. At this point its oldest game Castle Marrach is completely run by the players, and 7 more games are being developed by their customers. The company is at break-even, but is not yet a &#39;commercial success&#39;. There are some learnings from the world of massively multiplayer online games that apply to other kinds of social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these learnings have to do with size of groups -- different sizes of teams and groups in games can have very different effects, both positive and negative. I&#39;ve never seen any Social Software that innately understands that a team of 7 behaves very different then a clan of 50 or a megaclan/tribe of 350. These behaviors have parallels to size of mailing lists, online communities, and even to the size of corporations. If Social Software can integrate an understanding of this then it might be significantly more successful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also interested in what I call &#34;social games&#34; for online games. I don&#39;t believe that current MMPORGs serve well what the industry calls the &#39;socializer&#39;, which consists of 15% of current gamer population, but may in fact be much higher if you include women who don&#39;t currently play as many online games. Two recent articles that I&#39;ve been collaborating with Shannon Appelcline on this topic:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_136.phtml&#34;&gt;Social Gaming Interactions, Part One: A History of Form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_137.phtml&#34;&gt;Social Gaming Interactions, Part Two: Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part three isn&#39;t available until next Thursday, but is on non-competitive social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
