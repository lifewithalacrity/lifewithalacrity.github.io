      <description>This blog has been quiet lately as I&#39;ve been doing a lot of work in the last year on the iPhone. I&#39;ve been speaking at conferences like eComm 2008 (presentation, video from panel), writing an book on the iPhone with my co-author Shannon Appelcline called iPhone in Action: Introduction to Web and SDK Development (first two chapters free), and I am one of the organizers for the upcoming iPhoneDevCamp 2, a MacHack style conference on August 1st-3rd, and I am working on some social software apps for the iPhone.</description>

      <description>I feel privileged and honored to have been part of the iPhoneDevCamp this last weekend. Over 380 iPhone developers came out to the Adobe Campus in San Francisco to help each other make the best possible web pages and webapps for the iPhone.
I was the keynote speaker on Saturday and Master of Ceremonies for the MacHack-style Hack-a-Thon Demo on Sunday.
At the Hack-a-Thon almost 50 iPhone web applications were demonstrated to an enthusiastic audience.</description>

      <title>Getting Ready for the iPhone</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been excited about the web capabilities of the upcoming iPhone for some time. As a reluctant laptop user (&amp;quot;oh, my aching shoulders&amp;quot;), there is real appeal to me in a better portable web browser. I have tried most of the PDA and cellphone browsers to date, and none offer more then a poor cousin to the web that we experience on the desktop.
Instead, the iPhone offers a desktop-class browser.</description>
