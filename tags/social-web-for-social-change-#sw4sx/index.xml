      <description>As part of being a&amp;#0160;member of the sustainable MBA community at Pinchot University, I have been trying to articulate what I like about the kinds of collaboration that are possible even inside a competitive industry. In our MBA program, we don&amp;#39;t just teach about competitive strategy&amp;#0160;(using classic&amp;#39;s like Porter&amp;#39;s book), but we also teach about the nature of&amp;#0160;coopetition. These practices&amp;#0160;are more&amp;#0160;likely to lead to sustainable businesses (not only sustainable=green, but sustainable=enduring).</description>

      <title>A Revised “Ostrom’s Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons”</title>

      <description>The traditional economic definition of “the commons” are those resources that are held in common and not privately owned. This is closely related to economic concept of public goods, which are goods that are both non-excludable (in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use) and non-rivalrous (where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others).
My own personal definition for the commons is broader — any regenerative, self-organizing complex system that can be drawn upon for deep wealth.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum of Consent</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/09/a-spectrum-of-consent.html</link>

      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/09/a-spectrum-of-consent.html</guid>
      <description>I have made understanding of consent and consensus, in both their human and technological forms, a major part of my career. I have explored them through my work in cryptographic technologies, but also in human terms at the&amp;#0160;Group Pattern Language Project, by co-authoring with Shannon Appecline forthcoming book on the design of collaborative games, and another book in progress on the patterns of cooperative play. My business management style is also more collaborative and inclusive.</description>

      <title>The Four Kinds of Privacy</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/04/the-four-kinds-of-privacy.html</link>

      <description>(This article has been cross-posted in Medium)

Privacy is hitting the headlines more than ever. As computer users are asked to change their passwords again and again in the wake of exploits like Heartbleed and Shellshock, they&amp;#39;re becoming aware of the vulnerability of their online data — a susceptibility that was recently verified by scores of celebrities who had their most intimate photographs stolen.
Any of us could have our privacy violated at any time… but what does that mean exactly?</description>

      <title>Mini Resume Card for Conference Season</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/03/mini-resume-card-for-conference-season.html</link>

      <description>Between the business of the March/April conference season and leaving Blackphone, I&#39;ve run out of business cards. Rather than rush to print a bunch of new ones, I&#39;m created this mini-resume for digital sharing and a two-sided Avery business card version that I am printing on my laser printer and sharing.
Not as pretty as my old Life With Alacrity cards, but effective in getting across the diversity of my professional experience and interests.</description>

      <description>If you consider yourself a futurist or an agent of change, you should read this article from The Atlantic &amp;quot;Shaka, When the Walls Fall&amp;quot;. Yes, it uses a Star Trek episode as an allegory, it is a bit confusing and has a lot of complexity and depth, but it is a good introduction to a topic I care about — Deep Context Shared Languages.
I consider one of my missions in life to be to &amp;quot;create tools that allow people to communicate about complexity&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Post by Christopher Allen. Comments Actually, the implication of the study is that argument, as the term is conventionally understood, is a myth and that persuasion is functionally impossible. Also that nobody knows anything, nor can they. S.M. Stirling 2014-06-04T16:18:36-07:00   original layout</description>
