<div class="p-summary">I have now had CEOs of three different social networks send me emails asking me to compare Orkut to their service. I've not had a chance to dig deeply into good answers for each specific one, but I did have some general advice that I wanted to offer given my recent experiences with Orkut.com, and my evaluation and followup on various social networking services in December. Privacy First, be extremely careful about privacy issues.</div>

<h2><a class="p-name u-url" href='https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/02/confirmed_email.html'> Confirmed Email Privacy Hole at Orkut</a> </h2>
<div class="post-meta"> <time class="dt-published" datetime="2004-02-01 17:12:22 -0700 -0700">February 1 2004</time> - 1100 Words </div>

<div class="p-summary">Another Orkut user and I have confirmed a privacy hole in Orkut whenever you send a message to someone via Orkut. For instance, whenever I send a message to anyone in the system that is forwarded by email, in the message headers it will read: From: "Christopher Allen" &lt;member@orkut.com&gt; Reply-To: "Christopher Allen" &lt;christophera@alacritymanagement.com; When someone reads the message in their email software, the "From:" line will be my name but the fake email of &lt;member@orkut.com&gt; -- however, when you reply to it, it will use my real email address.</div>

<div class="p-summary">I've read of emails, Orkut messages, and blog postings since my post yesterday, so I thought I would share some with you. There have been a number of good posts, as well as user comments at Danah Boyd's blog Apophenia. Danah Boyd writes Correcting Marc Canter's Perception of My Views Marc - i don't believe that users should take these relationships more seriously; i believe that YOU should. Users will do whatever they damn well please, and i think that we should learn from them.</div>
