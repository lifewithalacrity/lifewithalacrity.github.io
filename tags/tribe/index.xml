      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/circle_of_hands.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/images/2008/09/22/circle_of_hands.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Circle of Hands&#34; alt=&#34;Circle of Hands&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We often think of communities as organic creatures, which come into existence and grow on their own. However, the truth is they are fragile blossoms. Although many communities surely germinate and bloom on their own, purposefully creating communities can take a tremendous amount of hard work, and one factor their success ultimately depends upon is their &lt;em&gt;numbers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a community is too small you&#39;ll often have insufficient critical mass to sustain it. Conversely, if it&#39;s too large you can end up with a community that&#39;s too noisy, too cliquey, or otherwise problematic. These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can analyze these community sizes in three ways. In this first article I&#39;m going to talk about numerical group thresholds that have been observed in various sizes of tightly-knit communities, while in its sequel I&#39;m going to talk about personal thresholds and how they relate to group thresholds. In my final post, I&#39;m going to consider how power laws and inequalities of participation further complicate these simple values in the creation of larger communities. Together these three articles constitute what I call &amp;quot;Community by the Numbers,&amp;quot; a theory of community size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I&#39;m going to point to some studies which support these numbers, in general my goal here isn&#39;t to try and prove this theory of community size numbers, but rather to lay the theory out completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tightly-Knit Group Thresholds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups can clearly exist at any size, from a partnership of two, on upward. However what I&#39;m going to write about here are the threshold values: the ideal numbers where a community seems to function best, and the less than ideal numbers at which a community begins to grow unstable, remaining so until a new threshold number is reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also specifically talking about groups that are both tightly-knit and participatory communities. Clearly Ford Motor Company, with 250,000 employees, doesn&#39;t match any of these group thresholds. But any self-contained community within Ford probably will (and in fact, it will probably be either a &amp;quot;Working Group&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Group&amp;quot;, both terms I&#39;ll explain below). Similarly, a non-corporate community that doesn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; everyone to participate won&#39;t work quite the same as a community that does require participation from each member (though that&#39;s again the topic of the third article in this series).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.singers.com/jazz/group7.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;132&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/images/2008/09/22/group7.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Group7&#34; alt=&#34;Group 7&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7, &amp;quot;The Working Group&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;Working_Group&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This community size probably runs from about 4-9 members, but 7 is a pretty good average, and one that shows up in &lt;a href=&#34;http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/workinggroup&#34;&gt;multiple studies&lt;/a&gt;. This number may well relate to the general &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_seven&#34;&gt;rule of seven&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/&#34;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt;), which suggests that 7 is a number that the brain can easily and intuitively comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become increasingly clear that a tightly-knit group of 7 is the first group size which is truly an optimal community size. Groups below this size can function effectively, but risk not having
enough manpower to deliver a result that everyone is happy with, or having insufficient viewpoints to avoid group think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven is not only an optimal size for a wide variety of corporate and government committees, it is also a healthy size for a small business and even a good size for a party of close friends. More importantly, 7 is a very comfortable group size as it &amp;quot;feels&amp;quot; relatively natural. At this size members find it easy to get to know the other members of the group, and they&#39;re able to function well together in a very intuitive and organic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=560,height=403,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;143&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Squad and Fire Team&#34; title=&#34;Squad and Fire Team&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/images/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
An interesting example of this group size is the modern infantry
&amp;quot;squad&amp;quot;, which consists of two fire teams of 4 people, and a squad
leader, for a total of 9 people. Each fire team is is large enough to
function on its own, but together the group of 9 can still have effective
small group dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is typically at this size that the first signs of leadership in a group informally emerge, but the leadership usually isn&#39;t overbearing at this level, nor does there tend to be any rebellion against it — perhaps because the group may be too small to elicit multiple leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;109&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/images/2008/09/22/lastsupper.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Last Supper&#34; alt=&#34;Last Supper&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;Judas_Number&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
13—&amp;quot;The Judas Number&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A group size of 13 doesn&#39;t represent a threshold ideal value, but rather a threshold nadir. It is one of the points where groups can change behavior and risk becoming dysfunctional. There&#39;s one of these nadirs beyond every group threshold, where the previously harmonious group dynamics become more difficult. I&#39;ve chosen to highlight this specific number because it&#39;s a point that small communities often hit, particularly as entrepreneurial organizations try to grow above their startup beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I should note that 13 isn&#39;t a precise number, but rather one offered because it&#39;s in the right range and because it&#39;s poetically easy to remember. The exact number occurs somewhere between 9 and 25, but I suspect it is worst in the range of 12-15.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a group of this community size no one ever feels like they get a fair share of time. Studies show that at this size participants underestimate the amount of time they contributed to the conversation, and thus will come out feeling like they were unfairly ignored despite having a fair share of the conversation. Groups of this size risk people being lumped into categories and ceasing to be trusted as individuals. In addition, problems start with the development of &amp;quot;too many chiefs,&amp;quot; yet there is not enough enough variety of non-chiefs for them to direct. Furthermore, multiple leaders may struggle for hierarchical status, increasing the conflict in an already troublesome group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your community is unfortunately stuck at this nadir, one of two things usually occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, the group shrinks. This could be because participants unhappy with the group dynamics abandon it; or it could occur in a more organized way with the unwieldy large group breaking into two or more smaller groups. For example, a terrible group of 13 could become two more functional groups of 6 and 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, more energy could be expended. This could be in the form of more formal organization, rewards for participation, or more time to be casual and socialize in order to shake off the tensions of this size group. Though these efforts don&#39;t usually change the size of the group, they can improve its dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy could also be spent to help push the group up to the next threshold. Though this could occur naturally — for example if the group focuses on a topic of particular interest that causes new people to continually be added. In addition, in order to grow a group to a new threshold it often requires the efforts of more than one leader to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group size of 13 isn&#39;t necessarily bad, just more difficult. Anthropological studies show that primitive hunting tribes often temporarily broke into &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot; of this size — my presumption is that the value of having that many people hunting together outweighed the social costs of the group. It is interesting that most juries are made up of groups this size. I believe that the social dynamics of this size of group with all new members creates some tension among the jurors, which may serve justice to make sure that all sides are considered by the jury without falling into groupthink. However, from my experience, the interpersonal conflict in a jury can also slow down the deliberation process and cause much frustration among the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/images/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png&#34; title=&#34;Non-Exclusive Networks&#34; alt=&#34;Non Exclusive Networks&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
50—&amp;quot;The Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More properly this group size falls in the range of 25-75 participants, but it seems to feel the most natural in the range of 50-60. Studies of the sizes guilds in online games &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html&#34;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; this hypothesis. For instance, based on graphs of the guild sizes in Ultima Online, groups have a median of 61 members. Similar numbers hold true in studies of a more recent game, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this value the &amp;quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&amp;quot; because it matches the lower end of a threshold that &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Robin Dunbar&lt;/a&gt; set for group sizes. However, at this size it applies to mostly non-exclusive groupings, which includes the above mentioned online guilds, many employee communities, and the majority of social gatherings that manage to rise above the size of a Working Group. Groups of this size &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be serious or take up a lot of time, but in general they are not exclusive — they don&#39;t tend to be the only group that individual participants are involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90—&amp;quot;The Dunbar Valley&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; As Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number communities grow, they reach a point where increased time obligations and the noise of socialization required to keep the group cohesive requires a much more serious commitment from the participants. Like the Judas Number, the Dunbar Valley is a threshold nadir where more energy is required to keep a tightly-knit community together;&amp;nbsp; either the community agrees to a higher level of commitment and grows to the next level, or the community splits apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found this to be true when growing a small business — where it is too small for any middle-management, but the sub-groups are too large for one person to manage effectively. I&#39;ve also seen this with more ephemeral groups, such as when a small conference that worked well at 60 participants tries to grow and finds at at 100 participants they can&#39;t sustain a high enough intimacy level.&lt;/p&gt;

Another illustration of the Dunbar Valley is the history of the ancient Roman &amp;quot;century&amp;quot;, a grouping that was originally 100 soldiers. However, as the years went by, centuries tended to decrease in numbers to only include 70 or 80 soldiers. This might well be due to Non-Exclusive Dunbar constraints: even in a very devoted group of military men, there was still the need for relationships with other century groups, with support staff, and with camp followers, ultimately lowering the attention that could be spent on the century itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;150—&amp;quot;The Exclusive Dunbar Number&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; Robin Dunbar got much of the discussion of group thresholds started with his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/dunbar93coevolutionOf.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans.&amp;quot; However, as I&#39;ve written &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, and as I&#39;ve described in this article, Dunbar&#39;s group threshold of 150 applies more to groups that are highly incentivized and relatively exclusive and whose goal is survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunbar makes this obvious by the statement that such a grouping &amp;quot;would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The result of the grooming requirement is that communities bounded by the Exclusive Dunbar Number are relatively few. You will find hunter/gatherer and other subsistence societies where this is a natural tribe size. You&#39;ll also find these groups sizes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/03/what_is_the_opt.html&#34;&gt;terrorist and mafia&lt;/a&gt; organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=430,height=279,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;129&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/images/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg&#34; title=&#34;The Sopranos at Dinner&#34; alt=&#34;The Sopranos at Dinner&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Clearly, as we step up toward higher group thresholds, more and more
time is required to simply keep the group going. You see this in
depictions of mafia life — in the TV series &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt; a lot of time
is spent dining, hanging out, and drinking together. That is part of that 42% social
grooming time required for that intense of a survival group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible for a large company to force groups up to this size by expending lots of energy (which is to say money) to keep it healthy. Apple did this during the invention of the Macintosh, the first OS X operating system, and the iPhone, but the intensity required of such large teams is not sustainable for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without that extra energy, few modern tightly-knit communities can reach this threshold, or else can&#39;t hold it for very long. Instead they fracture into groups of individual interest (even if they continue to &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; in the same real-world or online forum), which are more than more likely to be bounded by the Non-Exclusive Dunbar number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the difficulty in even arriving at the Exclusive Dunbar number, it may well be the highest limit of all for a tightly-knit community. Beyond this limit, communities are less cohesive, less trusted, and less participatory (and the topic of my third article in this series.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways to measure groups, and one is by counting its members. As I&#39;ve discussed here, the number of members can have a huge impact on whether the communities are successful or not. Thus, as community organizers, social software engineers, game designers, or as sociologists interested in community dynamics, we must ultimately consider group thresholds and group nadirs; to understand how to create cohesive communities, rather than groups that fly apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/11/personal-circle.html&#34;&gt;next article&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m going to talk about thresholds that are personal, rather then group-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;This view of group size dynamics has a lot of potential implications for all kinds of things including management science and more specifically/interesting to me startup dynamics. Namely, you&#39;re proposing an outline that can be mapped to company size and funding levels, amounts of management required/deployable etc. Have you thought of making a stronger connection in this area?

Reading :
&#34;These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.&#34;
Reminds me of Quantum states of Electrons spinning around the nucleus. So, maybe different quantic numbers of persons generate different energy levels, apt for different services?
Also as an analogy, if I recall well, when coming from an external path to an internal one allows the matter to shed light. So, maybe as we internalize we allow light to reach outward?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my initial blog entry on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; I presented some statistics on group sizes based on the online game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uo.com&#34;&gt;Ultimata Online&lt;/a&gt;. In it you could clearly see the power-law (pareto) curve, with diminishing returns at around 150, with most groups being 60 in size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html#onlinecommunities&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;550&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/UOGuildPowerLaw.jpg&#34; width=&#34;814&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickyee.com/&#34;&gt;Nick Yee&lt;/a&gt; and other researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/&#34;&gt;PlayOn Blog&lt;/a&gt; have been researching the behaviors of players in the popular &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; online game. At my request, they sampled guild sizes over a one-week period, and prepared &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html&#34;&gt;similar graphs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060205115408/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html&#34;&gt;internet archive link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(&amp;#39;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;popup&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;width=925,height=348,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Guildsize&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b image-full img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-800wi&#34; title=&#34;Guildsize&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Guildsizehisto&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b image-full img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b-800wi&#34; title=&#34;Guildsizehisto&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these statistics still support my original hypothesis in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; post that mean group sizes will be smaller than 150 for non-survival oriented groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&amp;#39;t have requisite variety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the diminishing returns for large groups in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; appear to cut off much sooner then they do in &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt;, with the 95th percentile 54 and the 99th percentile being 110. When I asked about why the &amp;#39;knee&amp;#39; was much closer to 50 rather than &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;knee around 150, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.legendmud.org/raph/&#34;&gt;Raph Koster&lt;/a&gt; (the game designer who gave me the original &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; data) answered that it might be because &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; used a &amp;quot;veteran member&amp;quot; method of counting. This could result in under reporting of new users and thus pushing up sizes of more established groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also different was the fact that the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; guild sizes display a reverse power-law, with the smallest groups being much more common, rather then the bell curve of &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt;. If one-person guilds are excluded, the average guild size was 16.8, the median was 9. This seems to correspond much closer to my thoughts on a smaller &amp;#39;nodal&amp;#39; threshold for group size that I&amp;#39;ve observed at around 15, which I describe in &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that there is something about &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; such that even participating in very small groups can be useful, whereas for &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; the utility is gained mainly by sharing the resources earned by larger groups. Thus &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; has groups that are &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot;, while with &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; groups are more llikely to be just &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve not had time to play &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; yet, so I&amp;#39;m curious if those who have more experience would agree with my hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I play WoW on a regular basis, and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by the preponderance of small guilds, as the best high-end gear is available in instances that require raids involving large groups of high-level players (up to 40 people). In fact, this is an oft repeated complaint on the WoW forums: smaller guilds do not have access to this gear unless they can manage to form alliances with other small guilds.
However, for low and mid-level players, going through instances only requires 5-player groups, and instances are usually the best source for great gear at every level, so for those players who haven&#39;t reached level 60 yet, there is no immediate advantage to joining a large guild.
I would therefore be curious to see a correlation between player level and guild size.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I play WoW and I&#39;ve never played UO but I&#39;ve heard from many MMORPG veterans that WoW is far too kind in terms of its penalities for death. In fact, there&#39;s little penalty for death besides 10% damage to your equipment (easily repairable) and walking your spirit back your corpse. In other games, things like gold, items, rank and experience can be lost as a result of character death.
This could mean that there&#39;s simply less of a survival mentality amoungst players and groups are formed for rewards rather than for aversion of penalties.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I don&#39;t know about UO, but WoW features individualised gear. Certain gear, once &#34;owned,&#34; simply cannot be passed on to someone else. As such, in the earlier levels, it&#39;s possible that players not even bother to join a guild. It&#39;s entirely viable to solo up until the high level instances. There isn&#39;t as much dependence on grouping.
My opinion, of course. YMMV.

Some facts about WoW guild sizes:
What is the point of a guild with one member? Since the guild name is displayed with your character, then it is like a last name for your character ( a further way to show how clever you are) even a guild of one can have it&#39;s own guild tabard
Guild of less then 5: You can only have 2 professions so it is worthwhile to team up with others that you can trade goods with tailoring/enchanting mining/blacksmithing skinning/leather-working there is also mining/engineering but almost none of the stuff engineers make can be shared so for lower level character a group of 3 can be VERY helpful, also 3 is an easy to maintain group size and obviously the killing/questing goes much faster. This group falls apart for characters higher then 30 (for reason listed below)
Guilds of around 5+: Most instance dungeons must be done with 5 players, each with a role (tank, healer, damage, off-tank, off-healer), a 3 player guild will need 2 pick-up players.  Pick-up players, as a rule, are used to playing solo and don&#39;t stay in a role as well, leading to lots of problems.
Guilds of around 40+: High lvl dungeons need 40 players, so I think your results would look extremely different if you only showed lvl 50 or higher characters also blacksmithing splits into 2 specialties and leather-working splits into 3 specialties leading to larger group size.
Another thing that affects group size is &#34;alts&#34;, if I create a killer guild, I am going to want all my characters to belong to it, even if I don&#39;t play them anymore.  So by looking a just lvl50 or higher characters I think you would strip out a lot of &#34;alts&#34;, and that would give a better &#34;real&#34; group size

WoW has taken a lot of steps to enable players to find players to group with, such as dedicated chat channels and a system allowing players to join a queue and be automatically placed in groups.  Also WoW is incredibly solo-friendly - you never need to group to get to level 60, and even some endgame content is accessible such as the PvP Battlegrounds.  The points already mentioned about the simple tradeskill structure and absence of tradeable &#39;hand-me-downs&#39; are crucial as well, so I&#39;m not too surprised you see a smaller average guild size.
If WoW incorporated a working formal alliance structure you might see it splinter even more.
On a more general note, if a guild is being formed for 40-person raids, only the hardest of the hardcore will actually have 40 players - they&#39;d want sufficient numbers to be able to routinely get 40 players of appropriate level and class distribution together.
My WoW guild has reached sizes where 40-person groups are sometimes possible spontaneously.  In my opinion we&#39;re skirting, and probably have crossed into, the &#39;too-large&#39; realm.  I find I&#39;m more likely to ignore guild chat, simply because there are so many people and things going on.  I also don&#39;t feel as close to guildmates - to the point of not recognizing some - which has never happened to me before.
I blame the game.  WoW owes much of it&#39;s success to being more casual friendly, and has a tendency to attract and even promote less social playstyles.  I notice my behavior is changed from past MMO&#39;s when I was perfectly happy to just chat for awhile.  In WoW everything is go, less (or no) downtime between fights, more interaction needed during battles (I most often play a rogue, which plays more like a FPS than anything else), less travel time, it all adds up to a game which is very fun, yes, but definatley less social.
P.S.  Anyone studied the effects of Teamspeak on optimal group/raid/guild sizes?

World of Warcraft is actually quite intricate in its workings. The style of play often changes with the level of the player&#39;s character(s). Also, the ruleset a person is playing on influences how they group and interact with people.
For instance, on the PvP servers, now that the majority of players have had high level characters for a while, practically no one does low-level instances. People are either busy in battlegrounds (BG&#39;s) or high level instances. So most people who aren&#39;t level 60 end up soloing or grouping with very few people. But a guild is ideal to have, as you can call people in for backup when enemy players are ganking you while levelling up. But this makes the size of these guilds rather arbitrary.
When a person reaches level 60 on the PvP servers, they tend to join a guild that participates in PvP fairly often. It doesn&#39;t require many people to PvP, as some BG&#39;s only allow 10 people. And those BG&#39;s that allow more are difficult to get into, so people only enter in small groups anyway. Even for the small BG&#39;s it can be difficult to enter the server with a predetermined group, due to the way the queueing system works. So the desire for small groups on PvP servers is high (as it is easier to enter the BG&#39;s). This can make some guilds fairly small.
It should be noted about the PvE ruleset that a lot of low-level players are able to participate in low-end 5-to-10-man dungeons (almost always done with 5), as the interest in fairly high amongst those levelling up alts and new players. So people new to this low-level content often join small guilds, or guilds with a vast number of low-level alts.
Now, when people participate in high-level dungeons, things are a little different. Really, there is only one high-level dungeon that is for five people. And there are a few high-level dungeons that allow for 10 or 15 people, but neither they nor the 5-man dungeon offer the best loot. This causes only casual players to really concentrate on that content.
Sometimes, a player will want to approach the game in a serious, hardcore manner, but because they can&#39;t handle large groups or are generally anti-social, they may end up staying in a smaller guild. I&#39;ve encountered three cases of this, all of which involved personal online gaming friends.
In terms of hardcore, high-level content, you have three 40-man dungeons (however, I&#39;d classify one of them as a simple encounter), one 20-man dungeon and two outdoor, 40-man encounters that offer the best loot. With the addition of the 20-man raid dungeon, I expect average guild sizes will fall slightly. But I&#39;m sure there will be plenty of guilds concentrating on the 40-man PvE content.
In order to do the complex 40-man raid dungeons, you need a guild that has at least 40 people that can play regularly, the right class setup, and backups to take the place of crucial missing pieces. However, I have often found that there are &#34;regulars&#34; that show up to almost every raid. This means the number of backups is usually relatively small.
This explanation is not very eloquent, I realize, but I hope it brings some insight into things. It&#39;s rather a subjective opinion, as well. I don&#39;t have numbers to back this up--it&#39;s all based on personal experience with both rulesets.
&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your open question as to whether World of Warcraft had some characteristics that caused it to trend towards lower guild sizes.
I&#39;ve been playing World of Warcraft since release. In short, your answer is &#34;yes&#34;.
Compared to other MMOs, World of Warcraft is different in significant respects. The level grind to cap (60) is -much- less intense than in comparable games. I believe that the average time to 60 in terms of days played is about 15 days and it can be much less for a veteran player.
WoW is very quest-oriented and a majority of quests are accomplishable solo. Quests usually fall into the typical categories of kill-quests, loot-quests, and Fedexes. If you want to level quickly, you do this by solo grinding and cherry-picking quests.
On the path to 60, WoW offers several instanced raid dungeons. On the alliance side, there&#39;s Deadmines, Stockades, Shadowfang Keep, Uldaman, Scarlet Monastery, Zul&#39;Farrak, Maraudon, Sunken Temple. These instances have some quests in them, but, in addition, they&#39;re participant-capped. No more than 5 grouped players can be in the instance parts of these dungeons.
This has the effect of allowing guilds with less than 5 regular people to successfully reach level cap as a social group.
Once a player reaches 60, however, things start to change. 60th level players very quickly exhaust the number of quests that are available to them. This leaves only the high-end instances to do:
Blackrock Depths
Stratholme
Scholomance
Blackrock Spire
Zul&#39;Gurub
Molten Core
The maximum number of players who can participate on these endgame instances increases dramatically. Blackrock Depths is limited to 5 participants. Strat and Scholo are 10, I think. Blackrock Spire is 15. Molten Core is 40. Zul&#39;Gurub is a new &#34;starter&#34; raid instance that requires 20.
Small guilds who make it to 60 often find that they are &#39;stranded&#39;, without enough critical mass to perform the higher level raid instances but without the connections to join with other guilds to participate in them. This abrupt transition of the gameplay at the end from casual to hardcore is a common player complaint.
Another factor that may lead to smaller guild sizes in the endgame compared to Ultima Online is that practically all raid content IS instanced. This means that to get the best loot, a guild needs to be able to muster only the raid-limit cap for that particular instance. In contrast, in Ultima Online, my understanding is that many of the end-game bosses are out &#39;in the open&#39; and on long spawns. This means that to achieve success, guilds in that game not only need to be able to muster enough players to defeat the raid encounter but must ALSO achieve enough mass in order to prevent other guilds from dominating the spawn. This becomes a sheer numbers game.
&lt;/p&gt;

While I have not played WOW, in EVE-online another MMPOG, the occurence of corporations smaller than 3 is usually because the members are subverting the rules.
samll corps exist so that people can play solo, outside of the normal social infrastructure. In dangerous areas the new player corps are normally Kill On Site, so experienced solo players create a corp for the small number of characters that individual person operates.
small corps exist so that you can declare war and blackmail other corps without your main corp suffering any fallback.
Or they serve as peoples murderous &#39;alt&#39; characters, again so that you can avoid any come back onto your main character or corp.
small corps exist so that they can create clones without needing to build high standing of your main corp (a sort of game exploit).
small corps exist to scam money out of people by creating fake lotteries etc
small corps exist so that an alt character can run a business away from the normal agreed rules of the corp that the main character is part of.
If similar things happen in other MMPOGs, it might be worth ignoring the small groups when drawing conclusions about social groups, they usually exist to either be explicitly anti-social or to subvert the game mechanics in some way.

      <title>My Advice to Social Networking Services</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/02/my_advice_to_so.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2004 11:39:47 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/02/my_advice_to_so.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have now had CEOs of three different social networks send me emails asking me to compare Orkut to their service. I&#39;ve not had a chance to dig deeply into good answers for each specific one, but I did have some general advice that I wanted to offer given my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html&#34;&gt;recent experiences with Orkut.com&lt;/a&gt;, and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html&#34;&gt;evaluation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2003/12/followup_to_eva.html&#34;&gt;followup&lt;/a&gt; on various social networking services in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Privacy&lt;/h4&gt;
First, be extremely careful about privacy issues. For some of you outside the US, you may not know about what has been going on in the area of identity theft, but it has become a significant problem. I am not a privacy fanatic, but I am concerned that social networking services encourage people to reveal too much information too broadly, and that this will be someday be taken advantage of by identity thieves. For instance, many services ask for birthday and reveal it to everyone. You can ask for the birthday, but don&#39;t display it -- give the person&#39;s age, or birth month, but don&#39;t give the full info. I personally am particularly wary of billing address, billing zip code, birthday, and potential common security questions like name of pet, mother&#39;s maiden name, etc. These are in addition to the obvious targets of identity theft like SSN, full name, and account numbers.
&lt;p&gt;Orkut&#39;s interface for selectively allowing some fields to be visible &#34;only to myself&#34;, &#34;to friends&#34;, or to &#34;friends of friends&#34; is nice, but I wish it was for all fields. I also think every field by default should be set to &#34;only to myself&#34;. In fact, all security parameters should default to reveal the least information, and have the tightest limits -- allow the user to open selectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to support all different kinds of social networks (dating, friendships, activities, business) consider finding ways to make sure that those people who are not using the service for dating are not asked for that info, and don&#39;t see it for others who are dating. People who are only using it for dating shouldn&#39;t see business info. If someone is using a service for all types of relationships, allow people to selectively set what they reveal to each group, say two columns of &#34;only to connections who are dating&#34; or &#34;only to business connections&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never reveal someone&#39;s email address or other critical information without them knowing about it. In particular there are issues with emails sent among members. The only safe way is to do redirection through your site (although that will cost you bandwidth.) But if you can&#39;t do that, then just tell people &#34;your email will be revealed if you do this&#34; -- that is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work hard on your TOS and Privacy terms. Don&#39;t let your lawyers rule you here too much -- find some way to get your principles out there and still cover yourself against problems. Make all the personal information that people give you be their information -- they are only leasing it to you temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it easy for someone to quit the system. Maybe offer to them to export their information in case they want to rejoin later, and give them an opportunity to send a last message to any connections they may have. Be friendly at all times, and as the market shakes out they may come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Connections &amp; Invites&lt;/h4&gt;
If possible, find some other way to call the connections between people &#34;friends&#34; -- maybe even use a unique trademarkable term. There is some power in the emotions behind the word friends that helps with the virus-like nature of social networking software, but I think in the long term it is a bad idea. LinkedIn and Spoke use the word connections which sounds too mechanical, but I think it is better then &#34;friends&#34;.
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t encourage the &#34;how many friends do my friends have&#34; game. It sets up bad behaviors, and as you grow you don&#39;t want to have barriers of entry to new people who feel that they can&#39;t compete in that game. This means don&#39;t sort friends or groups etc. by the number of friends they have by default -- it can be an option, but just not be default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t encourage people to by default upload their address book. Have that feature be off of some optional utility page. Have the default option for it to just scan for people that are already members of your system and to forget the rest -- that is effectively what I do with systems that ask for address book information, and they make it hard for me to do so. Don&#39;t store people&#39;s address information for them unless you can sync them with people&#39;s personal contact books -- save that for version 2.0, not 1.0 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t focus on people contacting new people that are not already their connections. It is not the number of connections, but the quality. Instead, focus on helping people with their weak connections. It is &#39;reconnection&#39; that is the most powerful feature of these social network services, not new connections. You can also help with &#34;triage&#34; -- how do I maximize the value of my existing weak connections with the least effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow people to opt-out with a custom message. What this means is that if someone sends an email to someone who has opted out, they will get something like. &#34;Thanks for inviting me to Orkut -- I&#39;ve decided for now not to join, but you can find me on Tribe.&#34; However, keep a list of people who have tried to connect to that opted-out user, and if that user does change their mind later, it will make it easier for them to have an initial list of friends that may already be on the service. Yes, I know that this risks sending people to other services, but there are so many now that you can get good buzz by doing the right thing, and recovering those people later when they have confidence in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to have better methods of handling invites from unknowns without saying no. For instance &#34;I&#39;m not sure I know you, have I forgotten?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related, don&#39;t fill out default text for invitations and other request forms -- force people to put something personal into the request, don&#39;t allow it to be blank. Never do what Orkut does and not give the opportunity to offer text when you invite someone who is already on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid anything beyond friends of friends as a primary part of your service. It bugs me that I see by default 3 degrees away in many services -- 2 degrees should be max by default, as that is the level that real referral can work. 3 degrees is too far for users to trust (though it can be optional for some purposes, or useful internally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=6080f857- 4784-4679-8e41-c6881ed933ce&#34;&gt;Friendship Circle&lt;/a&gt; may also be a good idea, though perhaps how you classify people should be private. You may mark someone as being &#34;family&#34; &#34;intimate&#34; or &#34;acquaintance&#34; or &#34;business&#34;, or whatever, however, no one else should see that; they should just see &#34;connection&#34; unless they have named you, and you in turn should not say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Profiles&lt;/h4&gt;
Find some better way then simple lists to do profiles. Someone&#39;s profile needs to express the richness of who they are -- it also needs to change and grow and flow over time, so make it easy for people to annotate and grow over time. Consider asking for only a few things at first, not make the process of filling out the profile feel daunting, then after each login prompt them to add one small thing that is useful based on how they used the service recently. For instance &#34;You have joined the AnyoneButBush2004 group -- do you want to enter information to share with others about your political interests?&#34;.
&lt;p&gt;Right now lots of people are experimenting on their blog sidebars how best to profile themselves -- learn from them. Look at hundreds of examples, look for patterns beyond the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow people to have multiple affiliations, whether they be work or play. I&#39;m a bad edge case personally, with too many hats to name, but almost everyone I know has at least two professional hats &#34;Sysadmin by day, Writer by night&#34;, &#34;Laywer on weekdays, Carpenter on weekends&#34; , as well as several affiliation hats &#34;Bay Area Costumer Guild president, member of League of Women Voters&#34;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now LinkedIn has the best looking professional profile, but it is still hard for some people to use. I like LinkedIn&#39;s use of multiple professional affiliations, however, I wish I could mark some as major or minor; for instance, there is a big difference between being an Advisor to MG Taylor and being CEO of Consensus. It also doesn&#39;t handle professional associations and lesser affiliations, much less non-professional affiliations and interests. Also, being able to arbitrarily order them would be nice, LinkedIn does it by date which can make for some confusing emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reputation &amp; Endorsements&lt;/h4&gt;
Be very careful of the design of rating systems and reputation systems. They are extremely difficult to design well, as they too often can be gamed, or fall into reciprocity such that they are meaningless. My personal advice is just don&#39;t do it at first -- save it for a 2.0 version of the product, not 1.0 beta. If you are going to do it now, really study it -- there is a lot of good academic research on issues of reputation. It can be hard to slog through but it is worth it. Offer a grant to Danah&#39;s school for them to do research for you on the topic.
&lt;p&gt;Endorsements are a best way of doing reputation for now. They is also is imperfect and vulnerable to reciprocity games, however, as least you can see if two people are playing that game just by looking at the endorser and endorsee. If you find too much reciprocity you can basically ignore both players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow endorsements at a more granular level. For instance, if you are offering dating and professional information, segregate the endorsements. Even more ideally, do like LinkedIn and allow endorsements of relatively small things in a profile, for instance &#34;I really enjoy Chris&#39; blog&#34; against the blog profile item, and &#34;I like what Chris says about the environment&#34; against my affiliation with a group. Consider allowing endorsements of groups: &#34;Of the three groups here on Wiki, I find this one fits me the best&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can afford it, consider hiring a game designer from the online game industry who understands behavior incentives in online games. If you can&#39;t, study it. Part of the reason why EverQuest is the largest MMPORG is because it incentivizes certain kinds of social behaviors. In fact, it could be considered to be a type of social network service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Launch &amp; Support&lt;/h4&gt;
Be careful with your beta launch -- a culture for a community forms in the first few weeks, and our experience from online games is that the nature of this culture can make or break a project. Find ways to encourage the kinds of behaviors you want, and discourage those that you don&#39;t.
&lt;p&gt;Be very careful of labeling people who are gaming your product in ways you don&#39;t like. Being in Orkut&#39;s &#39;jail&#39; is almost becoming a badge of honor. There is no reason why people who invite too many friends to join, submit too many posts to forums, or sends too many messages to friends of friends, should be put under the same label as those people who put child pornography up on your system and thus you&#39;ve banned them. Instead, slow down the overly active people, just say in advance &#34;If you invite this number of people, you may not invite more people for 24 hours, do you want to continue?&#34;, or &#34;If you invite this person, you must wait an hour before inviting another.&#34;, etc. Also, if you do lock people out of a feature, don&#39;t lock them out of all features, just the one that they are over-using. If someone gets locked out of lots of features at the same time, then they should be looked at for possibly banning, but not if they are doing just one thing -- you want to encourage their enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you give feedback to anyone that tries to be helpful, for instance in reporting a bug. Ideally public reports should be encouraged public (as this encourages other people to be helpful) but even private reports should be encouraged, and as promptly as possible including &#34;Thanks for taking time to write up this, we are logged this problem and hope to get to it as soon as we can given limited resources.&#34; Find other ways to give feedback, such as a weekly report, or a group developers blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create multiple stages for your beta, for instance &#34;profile features beta&#34;, &#34;group features beta&#34;, &#34;scaling beta&#34;, &#34;load beta&#34;, etc. Tell people in your beta what you want to hear about and not hear at each stage. As each stage ends, find some way to publically thank those who made the biggest difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up a bug tracking system like TypePad has (like Bugzilla but hugely simpler to use). From help menu at the top you can click to post a new report, see all open reports, or see all closed reports. Every help page can have at the bottom to open a report on that topic. If anything goes wrong there (404, various system error messages, etc) you should give you an opportunity to open a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Features&lt;/h4&gt;
Figure out how to use RSS everywhere for input and output -- if Orkut or Tribe&#39;s group features supported RSS feeds, they could be very powerful competition to the hugely funded Friendster. Figure out how to use trackbacks with your system, and make them simpler for users. Make group bookmarks and other lists available as OPML. I&#39;m not a huge fan of FOAF yet, but figure out how to use it anyhow (and maybe vCards) until something better comes along, if nothing else but allow someone to import it and export it.
&lt;p&gt;My personal take is that if you can combine a substantial number of these &lt;br /&gt;
features, you could have a great product that gives the others a run for the &lt;br /&gt;
money:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offering intentional groups (like Tribe and Orkut) is essential. It is Friendster&#39;s and LinkedIn&#39;s weakest link.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eVite/Meetup style invitations for both private functions (come to my birthday party), friend functions (anyone near 00301 want to have lunch Thursday?) and groups (Let&#39;s all meet for dinner next week to discuss this).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to import via RSS the recent items from my blog to my profile page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional blogging-style home pages (FunChain &amp; Live Journal) for those who don&#39;t already have blogs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extended family support as an explicit type of group, grandmother, mother, child in college&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couples can be a form of a group also&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better ways to organize groups of groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better support for user-optional presence &#34;There are members of this group who are reading it right now who have said that they are available online to members to this group, 3 via Skype, 12 via AIM&#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=94333937-ecd8-4d08-994d-7f4c96c523dd&#34;&gt;Permachat&lt;/a&gt; at a group level is an interesting idea. I hate that I can&#39;t see chat text before the point I logged in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of group management support, for instance:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ability to have multiple admins (eGroups, Live Journal)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group moderation (Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Advogato, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional group shared links (eGroups)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional group shared calendar (eGroups)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polling inside groups (no one that I know of)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invitation or approval of entry by different methods, such as by vote, by 1 reference from existing member, etc. (none that I know of)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to merge groups (none that I know of) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wiki-style areas available for groups (no one that I know of)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine all the above with good innovative RSS and optionally Atom (FunChain, SocialText)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports the various blog submission APIs for blogs, wiki, and groups (none that I know of)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a great job for those who don&#39;t use RSS and those APIs to use email instead, including email submission (you can mail pages to a SocialText wiki)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to be federated, i.e. I could still use my existing blog (you just mirror it), RSS aggregation, my FOAF file could be synced, you sync with my addressbook at Yahoo, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Business Models&lt;/h4&gt;
Business models for social networking services is going to be one of the biggest issues. Even those social networking sites with lots of money behind them are going to have difficulty because there are so many.
&lt;p&gt;The paid subscriber model is probably dead until some of the VC funded startups go out of business. Advertising can be a good model, but be careful not to make it obtrusive -- remember, Google has made good money with very simple ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t have VC funding, find ways to co-opt partners -- build from the beginning support for Google AdSense and Adwords, Amazon APIs, etc. If you are small, consider federating with another company. Figure out what you can do to differentiate yourself from both your competitors and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t be evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Me&lt;/h4&gt;
I am interested in getting more professionally involved with social software. I think we are still in Apple II days of social software -- we see the promise of things to come, but we are still typing in ALL CAPS. Given the overfunding in this field, my own ability to start a company as an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alacrityventures.com&#34;&gt;angel investor&lt;/a&gt; is insufficient, so I&#39;m looking to partner with others. I&#39;ve been involved with online communities, groupware, collaboration, and security for over 20 years. If you are interested in an executive in this area, see my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844&#34;&gt;profile on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Some notes:
a) On privacy -- the list of people who tried to reach you is two-edged,
you may want to point that out, because it gathers my list of friends,
and somebody else might come and get it, but it is pretty useful.
b) All these ideas and many others are good, and I have my own lists
of useful features,  but there&#39;s some huge feature creep and it will
be tough for the people doing this software to cherry pick.
c) I have notes in the orkut forum (I presume you posted this there)
about dealing with people you don&#39;t remember.  It doesn&#39;t work to force
me to send them a note saying &#34;where do I know you from?&#34; because if
you forgot them it&#39;s still embarassing.   You need to establish a principle
in advance that people doing an invite include where they know you from.
Unless they are intimate friends.
d) On dating/non-dating, I agree that we don&#39;t want to see that our
business associate is in an open marriage.  However I am not sure the
moded UI (you are either in biz mode or dating mode) will fly.  I had
big plans for such modes, on backburner for now.
A better idea would be to only show you dating info on people who are
potential dates.   Ie. if you are an M seeking F, you only see dating
info of F seeking Ms.  People want the serendipity of knowing, &#34;Oh, that
women I met at the conference is single and looking?&#34;
Best of all it doesn&#39;t require new UI.
The other big thing with Orkut is going to be the FoF spam.  The mail
volume must be limited some way.  We&#39;ve got many thousands of FoF it
seems.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Good advice overall.  You might want to take a fast look at how phpbb does polls (re your &#34;polling inside groups&#34; note).  It&#39;s integrated into the comment posting interface so you can very quickly turn any entry into a poll, with a few simple options.
I&#39;d also be interested in seeing your comments on pay vs. free membership options.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;What do you think about the political applications of friendster-like sites?  Think how it helps solve the problems associated with the ghetto email petitions of the past, and how it could create a non-intrusive, viral fundraising medium.  Do you agree with me?
Given the multiple kinds of ways that people want to use social software (e.g., business networking, dating, politics), will there be specific sites for each kind of activity or will there be some sharing model?
Anyway, we&#39;re thinking about leveraging this trend and it would be helpful to get your thoughts as we consider build vs. partnering, etc.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;FriendBlend is another new social networking site you might want to take a look at - it combines match-making with blogs, moblogs, online photo sharing and a lot of the group features such as polling and quizes that you mention. Great post!

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;URL:
http://www.egrupos.com/
is virtually unknown in the US but becoming very popular in Spain and Latin America, and they&#39;re becoming a trend-setter, integrating email groups (a la YahooGroup but perhaps even more customizable), social networking tools and online auctions. A weird combination that however it seems to be working ok so far.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Thanks for posting this your section about privacy is very useful. There are some issues regarding privacy and social networking sites that have not been addressed properly and may cause the downfall of social networking sites such as stalkers and identity fraudsters.
