      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a keynote speaker for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nvhainnovations.org/2005/index.htm&#34;&gt;FVHA (Future of Voluntary Health Associations) Conference&lt;/a&gt;
in Atlanta today. My job is to give to this community a gentle
introduction and overview of concepts and products related to Social
Software and Social Networking. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/FVHA_Social_Software_Keynote_Presentation.pdf&#34;&gt;My slides are here - 6.6MB .pdf&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my research about this community, I find that they have some unique and interesting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/photos/uncategorized/acsrelay.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Acsrelay&#34; alt=&#34;Acsrelay&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;
The attendees of this conference are a collection of VPs and national
directors from major Voluntary Health Associations such as American
Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, March of
Dimes, etc. In turn, these Voluntary Health Associations organize
communities in order to raise funds for, and inform the public about
the medical implications for the different health problems that each are
concerned with. These associations have an organized volunteer base of
over five million people and raise in excess of two billion dollars
annually. They all have dedicated and diverse volunteer communities
which include practicing MDs, scientific researchers, health educators,
business executives, and working and nonworking mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it is the quantity of people served, the diversity of their
communities, and in particular, the need to dive deep into information
that makes these Voluntary Health Associations interesting. A women diagnosed
with breast cancer will need to make educated decisions about her own
health care in order to give informed consent. Yet she may not have the
education experience or background to understand the care decisions she
must make. She may not even have a current era computer. There are
few other online communities that need their members to understand so
deeply such difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus the desire of these associations to look deeper in to Social
Software. Of course, their key interest is in better understanding,
motivating, and expanding their volunteer networks. They are already
experts in the business of organizing traditional communities, but now
they have to deal with the changing nature of communities as their
members are now using the internet as the primary source of
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally Social Software can help increase their sense of touch with
their volunteers, it can empower volunteers to collaborate and work
harder and in new ways, it can increase information sharing and
innovation, and it can help drive fund-raising numbers higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the
openness of social software comes with a price. For instance, many of
these associations are afraid of enabling even simple unmoderated
discussion lists, in fear that bad or inappropriate information would be shared. There are also legitimate concerns about the quality, audience level, and attributation for even correct information. In the Q&amp;amp;A after my presentation I tried to explain how, when looking at individual blogs, or individual events of info vandalism, it is not really relevant if the communities and processes behind the Social Software are able to correct or filter those events. This is a difficult point to get across, as it requires people to learn to trust a system where the squeaky wheels and trolls are the loudest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/photos/uncategorized/acslogowhite.gif&#34; title=&#34;Acslogowhite&#34; alt=&#34;Acslogowhite&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;
One particular interesting thing about this conference is that
it is one of the first between multiple associations. I know from some
other non-profits that I&#39;m working with that they often feel in
competition for funds and resources from other non-profits, so I
applaud the American Cancer Society for sponsoring this cross-pollination effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;This is something very beneficial for humanity. Helping people voluntrary is not an easy job but  FVHA (Future of Voluntary Health Associations) is doing it easily and people are helping this association.
