<div class="p-summary">As part of being a&#0160;member of the sustainable MBA community at Pinchot University, I have been trying to articulate what I like about the kinds of collaboration that are possible even inside a competitive industry. In our MBA program, we don&#39;t just teach about competitive strategy&#0160;(using classic&#39;s like Porter&#39;s book), but we also teach about the nature of&#0160;coopetition. These practices&#0160;are more&#0160;likely to lead to sustainable businesses (not only sustainable=green, but sustainable=enduring).</div>

<div class="p-summary">The traditional economic definition of “the commons” are those resources that are held in common and not privately owned. This is closely related to economic concept of public goods, which are goods that are both non-excludable (in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use) and non-rivalrous (where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others). My own personal definition for the commons is broader — any regenerative, self-organizing complex system that can be drawn upon for deep wealth.</div>

I have explored them through my work in cryptographic technologies, but also in human terms at the&#0160;Group Pattern Language Project, by co-authoring with Shannon Appecline forthcoming book on the design of collaborative games, and another book in progress on the patterns of cooperative play.

Our panelists will look at bitcoin&#39;s predecessors and close cousins.

<div class="p-summary">In 2009, Elinor Ostrom received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her “analysis of economic governance, especially the commons”. Since then I&#39;ve seen a number of different versions of her list of the 8 principles for effectively managing against the tragedy of the commons. However, I&#39;ve found&#0160;her original words — as well as many adaptions I&#39;ve seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.</div>

<div class="p-summary">As I head out next week to the RSA Conference I realized that it has been 13 years since I attended the first one. I remember fondly the potential and power of cryptography technology in 1991 -- public keys, digital certificates, new possibilities for privacy, digital cash, etc. After 8 more years I left the compujter security industry on March 15, 1999. The computer security industry also seemed to be filled with as much potential as it did back in 1991.</div>

<h2><a class="p-name u-url" href='https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/02/confirmed_email.html'> Confirmed Email Privacy Hole at Orkut</a> </h2>

<div class="p-summary">Another Orkut user and I have confirmed a privacy hole in Orkut whenever you send a message to someone via Orkut. For instance, whenever I send a message to anyone in the system that is forwarded by email, in the message headers it will read: From: "Christopher Allen" &lt;member@orkut.com&gt; Reply-To: "Christopher Allen" &lt;christophera@alacritymanagement.com; When someone reads the message in their email software, the "From:" line will be my name but the fake email of &lt;member@orkut.com&gt; -- however, when you reply to it, it will use my real email address.</div>

<div class="p-summary">Like many others, I've been paying attention to Orkut in the last couple of weeks. I've answered more requests to be &quot;friends&quot; on Orkut then I have of any of the other half-dozen Social Networking Services I've tried, and I've looking at other people's friends to see if I know anyone. I've yet to ask someone to join Orkut that wasn't already a member, and I've been careful to not have anyone as a &quot;friend&quot; that I didn't know reasonably well and I thought knew me.</div>

<div class="p-summary">After a week where I met a number of bloggers and social network / social software people, I decided to try to update my various networks at Ryze, Tribe.Net, LinkedIn, and Friendster. These are my observations of these social network services after a few weeks of work. Overview of Social Network Services ChristopherA @ Ryze This was the first social network service that I signed up that seemed to already have some of my friends on it.</div>
