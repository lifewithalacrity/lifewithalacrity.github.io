      <description>For the last several months I&#39;ve been working on a new open source project that I&#39;ve been calling SynchroEdit. SynchroEdit is a browser-based simultaneous multiuser editor, useful for &amp;quot;same-time&amp;quot; collaboration.
The basic concept is that it allows multiple users to WYSIWYG edit a single web-based document, all at exactly the same time. SynchroEdit continuously synchronizes all changes so that users always see the same version. They can also see each others&#39; changes as they type, see where each user is currently editing, and see each others&#39; changes by color.</description>

      <description>Joe Kraus, one of the co-founders of Excite, and new blogger has long been rumored to be working on a new wiki tool. Today at the Web 2.0 conference Joe finally unveiled JotSpot, a new type of wiki that they have named an &#34;Application Wiki&#34;. JotSpot appears to be not only an advanced wiki, but it also moves the predominantly text-based wiki toward being able to handle structured data and web application development.</description>
