      <title>Ratings: Who Do You Trust?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline.php&#34;&gt;Shannon Appelcline&lt;/a&gt;, has been working on a game rating system for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpg.net&#34;&gt;RPGnet&lt;/a&gt;. This has resulted in real-world application of the principles for designing rating systems which we&#39;ve previously discussed in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/collective_choi.html&#34;&gt;Collective Choice&lt;/a&gt; articles. Shannon&#39;s newest article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_196.phtml&#34;&gt;Ratings,
Who Do You Trust?&lt;/a&gt; offers a look at weighting ratings based on reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/shannon_appelcline.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Shannon_appelcline&#34; alt=&#34;Shannon_appelcline&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the &lt;a href=&#34;http://index.rpg.net/&#34;&gt;RPGnet Gaming Index&lt;/a&gt; we&#39;ve put this all together to form a tree of weighted ratings that answer the question, &lt;em&gt;who do you trust&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&#39;s how we measured each type of trust, and what we did about it:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume of Ratings for an Item.&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce a bayesian weight to offset the variability of items with low-volume ratings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume of Ratings by a User.&lt;/strong&gt; Give each user a weight based on his volume of contribution which is applied to his ratings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth of Content by a User.&lt;/strong&gt; Give each rating a weight based on the depth of thought implicit in the rating which is applied to that rating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These all get put together to create our final ratings for
the Gaming Index, with each user&#39;s individual rating for an item
getting multiplied by its user weight and its content weight, and then
all of that averaged with the other user ratings and the bayesian
weight too. The result is in no way intuitive, but users don&#39;t really
need to understand the back end of a rating system. Conversely we hope
it&#39;s accurate, or at least more accurate than would otherwise be true
given the relatively low volume of ratings we&#39;ve collected thus far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of Shannon&#39;s earlier discussions about the design behind the new &amp;quot;user content&amp;quot; based &lt;a href=&#34;http://index.rpg.net&#34;&gt;RPGnet Gaming Index&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Hmm, interesting on the weighting system.
Can you explain with more detail how the rating by depth of content is generated?
I&#39;m looking through the other articles, so hopefully I find the info there.

&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;URL:
My first pass system just used a different multiplier for weight based on the type of content:
1x for just a raw rating
2x for a rating with a non-blank comment
5x for a review (which goes through a different, approved content system)
My second pass system also included &#34;volume of ratings by user&#34; and thus applied a variable multiplier depending on how many ratings the user has made:
(0-2x) for a raw rating
2x(0-2x) for a rating with comment
5x for a review
The 0-2x is calculated as (# of ratings by user)/50, to 2 max.
I&#39;m pretty sure that the core weighting system by depth is producing better results, though I haven&#39;t done any studies of that yet. The additional weighting for volume by users has definitely prevented bias by hit-and-run raters who just stop by to rate one game that they&#39;ve been asked to.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using 5-Star Rating Systems</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2006/08/using_5star_rat.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2006 08:49:14 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2006/08/using_5star_rat.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/collective_choi.html&#34;&gt;Collective Choice: Rating Systems&lt;/a&gt; I discuss ratings scales of various sorts, from eBay&#39;s 3-point scale to RPGnet&#39;s double 5-point scale, and BoardGame Geek&#39;s 10-point scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;128&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/stars_1.gif&#34; title=&#34;Stars_1&#34; alt=&#34;Stars_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the various ratings scales, 5-point scales are probably the most common on the Internet. You can find them not just in my own RPGnet, but also on Amazon, Netflix, and iTunes, as well as many other sites and services. Unfortunately 5-point rating scales also face many challenges in their use, and different studies suggest different flaws with this particular methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sloan.ucr.edu/category/working-papers/product-reviews/&#34;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; using Amazon data has shown that many &lt;em&gt;undetailed&lt;/em&gt; ratings (where the rater isn&#39;t required to add any additional information other than the rating they select) show a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution&#34;&gt;bimodal distribution&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In other words the distribution of ratings tends to cluster around two different numbers (e.g., 1 and 5) rather than offering a normal distribution where the ratings cluster around a single height (e.g., 3). Thus the median of these ratings is not an accurate reflection of product quality, but instead is a statement of conflicting opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/collective_choi.html&#34;&gt;our own study&lt;/a&gt; using RPGnet data has shown that many &lt;em&gt;detailed&lt;/em&gt; ratings (where the rater does add additional information, in this case a full review) offer normal distributions, however it is biased toward the high end of the scale. On RPGnet, for example, we discovered that 90% of this 5-point rating system was 3 or higher with an average around 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://360.yahoo.com/profile-9lciejI3aafX1stHPoIRNmkmv4EowQ--&#34;&gt;Randy Farmer&lt;/a&gt; of Yahoo suggests that this scale limitation is particularly troublesome for fan-based ratings, such as those found on episodic TV sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the fans of a show evaluate the episodes, and being fans, will never rate an episode one or two stars, ever. I&#39;ve seen this attempted over and over on the net with the same results every time: Each episode of a show is 4-stars +/- .5 stars. This goes all the way back to the Babylon-5 website, probably the first source for this kind of data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And indeed, the TV episode &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tv.com/babylon-5/tko/episode/25148/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;14&#34;&gt;TKO&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s first season, is considered an entirely atrocious episode by even the fans. Yet it has a 6.1 of 10 &amp;quot;Fair&amp;quot; rating on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tv.com&#34;&gt;tv.com&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus even when a bimodal distribution is not a problem, on a 5-point scale the upward bias often results in only 2 or 3 meaningful data points. This is problematic because it minimizes differentiation. In many cases, a 5-star rating system where most of the ratings are either 3 or 4 is actually no better then just a thumbs-up/thumbs-down rating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, given that 5-point scales are probably here to stay, we are forced to make the best use of them we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to provide raters with &lt;em&gt;incentives&lt;/em&gt;, so that they provide meaningful ratings. We&#39;ve already seen that this can be done by requesting detailed ratings: when a person takes the time to write text, and knows that his name will be attached to it, he generally does a better job in his rating. There are other possible incentives techniques as well, such as RPGnet&#39;s new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_191.phtml&#34;&gt;XP System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we need to provide means for a 5-point scale to become more meaningful by encouraging raters to use not just the top half of the scale, but the bottom half as well. One method to accomplish this is to make ratings &lt;em&gt;distinct&lt;/em&gt; -- as I briefly mentioned in my previous article on this topic -- and encourage standards so that an &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; rating is 2 or 3, not 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of how to accomplish both of these goals with already existing 5-point rating scales, I&#39;ve detailed my own experiences with using ratings on two popular services -- iTunes and Amazon. By providing myself with incentives and making my use of ratings very distinctive, I have created more meaningful and useful output for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Music Ratings - iTunes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#39;s iTunes software offers you the ability to rate individual songs with a 0-5 Star rating. If you use iTunes with an iPod, you can change the rating of a song on your iPod and the change will be reflected in your iTunes database the next time you sync your iPod. The &amp;quot;Shuffle Songs&amp;quot; feature available on more modern iPods has an option to have songs with higher ratings be played more often. A very powerful feature, Smart Playlists, can dynamically create sophisticated playlists based on ratings. All of this makes rating music on iTunes very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Shannon and I wrote our Rating Systems article, I examined the ratings in my iTunes catalog. Using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://girtby.net/archives/2005/11/03/itunes-library-preening/&#34;&gt;Alastair&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; fabulous XLST &lt;a href=&#34;http://girtby.net/offerings/itunes-ratings-stats/&#34;&gt;iTunes rating statistics tool&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered that the ratings I created in iTunes clearly were biased overly high, matching the pattern we&#39;d described. I had far too many songs rated with 4 Stars, and almost nothing rated 1 or 2. This made my ratings less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&#34;6&#34;&gt;Here are some statistics from your iTunes Library: 4172 tracks, 412 (10%) rated&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th colspan=&#34;3&#34;&gt;Cumulative % of Rated&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;% of rated&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Actual&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Target&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Shortfall&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tracks rated 5 stars:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;112&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-22&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tracks rated 4 stars:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;183&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-57&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tracks rated 3 stars:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;92&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;94&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-44&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tracks rated 2 stars:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tracks rated 1 stars:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the last few months I&#39;ve completely revamped my iTunes ratings. Since I can&#39;t change the user interface, I&#39;ve changed my behavior. I&#39;m also taking advantage of two other fields: &amp;quot;checked&amp;quot; which I use to give more distinctiveness to my ratings, and &amp;quot;play count&amp;quot; which shows whether or not I&#39;ve listened to something through to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the criteria I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 5 - Exemplars &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_5_checked.png&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_5_checked&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_5_checked&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Only my most favorite songs are rated 5. They have to meet the following criteria: they make me feel good or excite me no matter how often I listen to them, I can typically listen to them often without getting tired of them, and they are the best of their particular genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 4 - Great &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_4_checked&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_4_checked&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_4_checked.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; There is only a small difference between a song that is rated 4 and 5 in my ratings -- typically it doesn&#39;t excite me or make me smile quite as much, or it isn&#39;t necessarily an exemplar of its genre. However, I still can typically listen to them often without getting tired of them. Items that are rated 4 and 5 are ones that I carry on my iPod Shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 4 - Great (Unchecked) &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_4_unchecked.png&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_4_unchecked&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_4_unchecked&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a few songs that I do consider to be great, but that I only want to play when I&#39;m in the mood for them, or I want to only play in a specific order, or they &amp;quot;don&#39;t play well&amp;quot; with other music. For instance I love the song &amp;quot;The Highwayman&amp;quot; by Loreena McKennitt, however, it is over 10 minutes long and I just don&#39;t want to hear that type of song unless I&#39;m in the mood for it. Other examples are the 12 songs that make up Mussorgsky&#39;s &amp;quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; -- I want them played in order when I do play them, and I really don&#39;t want them played in the middle of my other songs. Unfortunately, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items, so I don&#39;t have a Smart Playlist for these; instead I keep them in a regular playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 3 - Good &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_3_checked.png&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_3_checked&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_3_checked&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; These are songs I like. Typically I can play them regularly but not too often. Songs rated 3-5 go on my iPod Nano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 3 - Good (Unchecked) &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_3_unchecked&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_3_unchecked&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_3_unchecked.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a lot of music that I think is Good, but I don&#39;t want to play all the time. I have a large catalog of sound tracks from movies. All but a few of those tracks are in this category. Again, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items in a Smart Playlist, so I have several regular playlists for these items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 2 - Ok &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_2_checked.png&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_2_checked&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_2_checked&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I have very diverse musical tastes, starting with jazz, various ethnic and world music, and also including quite a bit of pop, rap, R&amp;amp;B, punk, and metal that I enjoy. I don&#39;t enjoy them all the time -- but I do like them to pop up every once in a while for variety. So I rate these 2 and leave them checked. I have an old 40GB iPod that I take on long trips, and it stores everything I have that is checked and rated 2-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 2 - Ok (Unchecked) &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_2_unchecked&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_2_unchecked&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_2_unchecked.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Some songs are OK, but I really have to be in the mood specifically for that song. Listening to Jimmy Buffet&#39;s &amp;quot;Margaritaville&amp;quot; can be a guilty pleasure on a lazy summer day at the beach, but it isn&#39;t something I want to regularly listen to. I have a number of special playlists for songs rated like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 1 - Don&#39;t Like &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_1_checked.png&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_1_checked&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_1_checked&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; These are the songs that I don&#39;t like. They&#39;re just not my style. Many are still quality music, they just doesn&#39;t work for me. I do keep most of these for completeness -- it might just be one or two songs on the album, and I want to keep the album complete. Or I keep it in case my tastes change. But in general, once something is rate 1 Star, I&#39;ll probably never listen to it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated 1 - Trash (Unchecked) &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_1_unchecked&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_1_unchecked&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_1_unchecked.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; These are songs that not only do I not like, they just are not good music. I don&#39;t like most rap music, but I can tell that most are still quality. Some are junk -- these I rate 1 and uncheck, and are candidates for deletion the next time I purge my collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unrated &amp;amp; Listened &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_0_checked.png&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_0_checked&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_0_checked&#34; /&gt;, playcount &amp;gt; 0:&lt;/strong&gt; If I&#39;ve listened to something through to the end, but haven&#39;t rated it yet, it shows up in this Smart Playlist. Periodically I check this Smart Playlist, sort by playcount, and try to rate everything that I&#39;ve listened to more then once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unrated &amp;amp; Unlistened &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_0_checked.png&#34; title=&#34;Myrating_0_checked&#34; alt=&#34;Myrating_0_checked&#34; /&gt;, play count=0:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the default when a new song is added to my library. So any song that is unrated, checked, and has a play count of 0 shows up in my &amp;quot;Unrated &amp;amp; Unlistened&amp;quot; Smart Playlist. When I&#39;m in the mood for variety, I go through this playlist and rate songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifying my rating system in this way has caused my average rating for music to change from around 4 to somewhere between 2 and 3. It will probably, over time, become closer to 2 as I rate more of my collection. This gives me a lot of distinctiveness so that I can create Smart Playlists that work well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;

&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously rating a large music collection can become a chore -- you don&#39;t want to spend your limited music listening time always fine tuning your ratings. So I have some approaches that make it easier for me to rate my music with less effort:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I sorted my catalog by my old ratings, and modified everything down by 1, Starting with everything rated 2 becoming 1, 3 becoming 2, etc. This gave me a good base to start with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/exemplar_smart_playlist.png&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=512,height=216,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;84&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Exemplar_smart_playlist&#34; title=&#34;Exemplar_smart_playlist&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/exemplar_smart_playlist.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Next I created Smart Playlists for each rating, i.e. &amp;quot;Rating 5 - Exemplar&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Match only checked songs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Live updating&amp;quot; checked. I then added &amp;quot;Play Count&amp;quot; as a column to my view, and sorted by it. This gave me the songs that I played the most and least, and I adjusted some songs up and down accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist.png&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=512,height=241,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;94&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist&#34; title=&#34;Plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Then I created a new Smart Playlist that simply plays songs rated 3 to 5, limiting the list to the first 100 GB selected by random (i.e. everything random), and saved this Smart Playlist as &amp;quot;Plays Well With Others&amp;quot;. I play this on occasion in the background, and when I hear something that jars me I know something isn&#39;t rated right. Thus without a lot of effort I can change ratings for songs that no longer fit their rating, or uncheck items where the rating was appropriate but it &amp;quot;didn&#39;t play well with others&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try to be aware when I&#39;m using my iPod of what a songs rating is, and change it if it seems wrong. The next time I sync the iPod my ratings will be adjusted in my iTunes catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/play_count.png&#34; title=&#34;Play_count&#34; alt=&#34;Play_count&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;I also try to be aware of Play Count -- this number only goes up if you play a song to the end. So even if I&#39;m not able to take a look at the rating (for instance when I&#39;m in a car), I can at least forward to the next song. Periodically I review the play counts for songs that I&#39;ve rated and consider moving them up and down accordingly. Of course, this means that I have to be careful and not let the iPod keep running when I&#39;m not listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tip for those of you that do put a lot of effort into your iTunes ratings: I&#39;ve learned the hard way that unlike most song information, the rating is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; stored in the song itself, so if your iTunes database gets corrupted, or you move your music to another server, you&#39;ll lose all your ratings. One way to avoid this is to periodically backup your ratings into a field that is stored in the song itself. I personally use the &amp;quot;Grouping&amp;quot; field as it is rarely used, select all songs with the same rating and click on &amp;quot;Get Info&amp;quot;, and change the Grouping field to &amp;quot;My Rating: 5 Stars&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only have 11% of my collection rated so far, but using this system I&#39;m finding it a lot easier to manage my ratings. I&#39;m already getting many benefits from it -- I&#39;m playing my music more often, my iPods typically have the music I want on them, and various music discovery services can use my ratings to help me identify new music I might enjoy. This provides the &lt;em&gt;incentive&lt;/em&gt; to keep me entering meaningful ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Book Ratings - Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon also uses a 5-Star rating system, and your ratings can be used by Amazon to help you find books that you might like. Though I like to support my local bookstores, it is this feature that brings me back to Amazon time and again. Whenever I browse through Amazon and see a book I&#39;ve already read I try to take the time to update my rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has a number of different tools to assist you in your ratings. If you are an Amazon customer, you can go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/iyr/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;collection=owned&#34;&gt;Improve Your Recommendations: Edit Items You Own&lt;/a&gt; and see all the books that you&#39;ve purchased and quickly rate them with a nice AJAX interface. You can also review items that you&#39;ve already rated, whether or not you own them, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/iyr/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;collection=rated&#34;&gt;Improve Your Recommendations: Edit Items You&#39;ve Rated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=509,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/amazon_your_media_library.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;159&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/amazon_your_media_library.png&#34; title=&#34;Amazon_your_media_library&#34; alt=&#34;Amazon_your_media_library&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Amazon has also recently added a very nice web service called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/library/&#34;&gt;Your Media Library&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to help manage your media library of books, music, and dvds. I personally only have used it to manage my books and dvds, as I find rating albums useless -- it is songs that I prefer to rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After browsing through my ratings to date, I discovered the same flaws I found iTunes -- my ratings typically were too high; most were a 4. This is particularly encouraged by the popup when your cursor is over the Stars &amp;quot;1 - I hate it, 2 - I don&#39;t like it, 3 - It&#39;s Ok, 4 - I like it, and 5 - I love it&amp;quot;. I suspect if I use the same trick that I use for iTunes of making a rating of 2 Stars mean &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; I could potentially cause the recommendation engine to be less effective (though it could possibly make it better, I don&#39;t know). So I am being much more brutal with my ratings and pushing many more down to 3, so that my ratings of 4 and 5 have more meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Stars &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_5_star.png&#34; title=&#34;Amazon_5_star&#34; alt=&#34;Amazon_5_star&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; These have to be the exemplars -- the best books I&#39;ve ever read, would be glad to read again, would be proud to show off on my best bookshelf, and will buy extra copies to give to friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Stars &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Amazon_4_star&#34; title=&#34;Amazon_4_star&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_4_star.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; These have to be really good books -- most of them I&#39;m willing to read again and I promote them by offering to loan them to my more discriminating friends. Although I may keep them on my bookshelf I&#39;d rather give them to a friend then sell them at a used book store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Stars &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Amazon_3_star&#34; title=&#34;Amazon_3_star&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_3_star.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; These are books are decent books, and I do share them with my voracious reader friends. But I don&#39;t push them and I&#39;m much more likely to sell them at a used bookstore then keep them on my shelf. This is the rating that I significantly underused previously, and I&#39;m finding that the key discriminator for me so far is how much I feel like recommending this to friends who are more discriminating readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Stars &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Amazon_2_star&#34; title=&#34;Amazon_2_star&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_2_star.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This rating is where the Amazon rating system fails the most -- these are suppost to be books that &amp;quot;I don&#39;t like&amp;quot;, however, most of the time I don&#39;t buy books that I probably wouldn&#39;t like, much less read them, so I have very few in this category. However, I&#39;ve decided this category is for books that are just not quite good enough, or are slightly disappointing. Not bad, or disliked, but just somewhat disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Stars &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Amazon_1_star&#34; title=&#34;Amazon_1_star&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_1_star.png&#34; /&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is where I put the books that I don&#39;t like, or worse, I hate. Not many here, but I&#39;m willing to risk more then many people are so I have some. Also books go here that just don&#39;t fit my interest, like romance novels that get recommended to me because I like some crossover fantasy-romance authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started more accurately rating my books at Amazon, I&#39;ve found that their suggestions for other books to read to be more accurate. Thus I am getting value from rating these books, and I have &lt;em&gt;incentive&lt;/em&gt; to continue to make the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering an incentive for people to rate is important for ratings of all sorts, with both individual gain and status recognition being powerful motivators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the easiest technique for making a 5-point rating scale more useful is to make it &amp;quot;distinct&amp;quot;. If a user has a more specific meaning for each rating, ratings will slowly settle toward a truer average, and thus more of each rating scale will be used. We&#39;ve also tried this technique recently on RPGnet, with our new &lt;a href=&#34;http://index.rpg.net/&#34;&gt;Gaming Index&lt;/a&gt;; and thus far our new 10-point scale -- which has distinct meanings for each number -- is averaging &lt;a href=&#34;http://index.rpg.net/browse.phtml?count=50&amp;amp;type=Best&amp;amp;productCategory=Entries&#34;&gt;7.27&lt;/a&gt;. That&#39;s still a fair amount above the real average of 5.5, but at least it&#39;s below the 8+ rating that our old double 5-point scale resulted in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often you, as a consumer of rating systems, will be making use of rating scales designed by others, rather than those you&#39;re designing yourself. For those cases it often makes sense to design your own rules for what each number means, and to do so in such a way that your median is the average of the scale, rather than toward one of the extremes. When you do, even if you&#39;re using a tight 5-point scale you&#39;ll end up with enough differentiation for it to actually be more meaningful than a thumbs up or a thumbs down.&lt;/p&gt;

Averaging all episodes you get a mean score of 8.19 with a standard deviation of 0.84 - a *very* narrow range.
Context and Motivation matter more than scale in getting reusable scores out of rating systems. As I like to tell the folks here at Yahoo! – the person creating the rating has to get something out of the transaction other than just altruism.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I thought the issue, like Randy Farmer suggests, was that only positive discrete scales always tend to their maximum.  The problem then in rating systems, like you mentioned I think earlier, is that readers have to interpret what the real norm and limits are.  Even if every rating is in the upper quartile.  You may want to check out what I did in Playerep (http://www.playerep.com), where the rating system is based on election but not a fixed scale (always norming to zero without influence).   FWIW. Thanks.

I like your classification scheme for iTunes. I&#39;m going to have to work on adapting my scale (which is definitely showing signs of skewing towards the high end).
One thing, though. You mention that you can&#39;t create smart playlists to show unchecked songs. It&#39;s true that you can&#39;t do it with only one playlist, but you can do so with 2:
#1) Any playlist (for example, let&#39;s say your smart playlist for 4 star, checked songs, so you have it set (I assume) for My Rating = 4, Match Only Checked Songs = checked)

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items, so I don&#39;t have a Smart Playlist for these; instead I keep them in a regular playlist.
You can:
Make a smart playlist called &#39;Checked&#39; with a rule that is always true (e.g. artist does not contain (leave the field emtpy), or bitrate &gt; 0). Create a smart playlist called &#39;Unchecked&#39; with the rule: &#39;Playlist is not Checked&#39;. There you have all your unchecked files.
From there you can make smart ones that use this Unchecked playlist.
I like your rating system. I have 40% on a 3star now, and around 25% for 2 and 4 stars. I might scale it down a little bit more.
hmm, after typing this I read the comments and see Adam McDonald already mentioned something similar about the unchecked items. I&#39;ll leave it here anyway...

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Christopher, I think some, if not all, of the issues with the 5-point rating system could be addressed with a better UI. For example, displaying a normal distribution curve skewed by accumulated rating to nudge raters away from the extremes. Of course, this doesn&#39;t work well if sample size is too small which usually happens on the far end of the long tail.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 0.7em;&#34;&gt;by Christopher Allen &amp;amp; Shannon Appelcline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This is the third in a series of articles on &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html&#34;&gt;collective choice&lt;/a&gt;, co-written by my collegue &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline&#34;&gt;Shannon Appelcline&lt;/a&gt;. It will be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml&#34;&gt;jointly posted&lt;/a&gt; in Shannon&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml&#34;&gt;Trials, Triumphs &amp;amp; Trivialities&lt;/a&gt; online games column at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/&#34;&gt;Skotos&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our first article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html&#34;&gt;collective choice&lt;/a&gt; we outlined a number of different types of choice systems, among them voting, polling, rating, and ranking. Since then we&#39;ve been spending some time expanding upon the systems, with the goal being to create both a lexicon of and a dialogue about systems for collective choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we&#39;re going to dig more into &lt;em&gt;comparison ranking systems&lt;/em&gt;, by focusing on &lt;em&gt;competitive&lt;/em&gt; rankings and looking more in depth at ELO Chess Ranking System and the other systems that we briefly mentioned previously. Our goal is to explicate these systems, to better address their flaws, to begin detailing the purposes of ranking systems, and to show how those purposes are critical in the design of ranking systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;subjective_vs_objective&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Subjective vs. Objective Rankings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our original article we discussed &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/collective_choi.html&#34;&gt;rating systems&lt;/a&gt; as being largely subjective and ranking systems as being objective, but the situation isn&#39;t nearly as simple as that. In truth, there&#39;s a clear spectrum of ratings and rankings with varying amounts of subjectivity and objectivity in each collective choice system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bcsfootball.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Bcs_1&#34; title=&#34;Bcs_1&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/bcs_1.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.officialworldgolfranking.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/golfrankings_1.png&#34; title=&#34;Golfrankings_1&#34; alt=&#34;Golfrankings_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series&#34;&gt;Bowl Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (BCS) for college football is a good example of a ranking system that explicitly allows a subjective component. It involves a complex mathematical formula that includes things like win/loss ratios, but also sportswriters&#39; and coaches&#39; ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, public opinion continues to show that people don&#39;t necessarily like seeing true ranking systems having subjective components, because they expect them to be &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot;. The BCS formula has come under attack several times in the last few years precisely due to its subjective basis. Cal Berkeley was one of several teams denied a bowl position in 2004 when many felt that they were worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atptennis.com/en/players/raceleaderboard/rank_definitions.asp&#34;&gt;APL tennis rankings&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_rankings&#34;&gt;official world golf rankings&lt;/a&gt; also have a subjective component, but it is much more subtle. Each tournament is worth a certain number of points, and the allocation of those points is relatively arbitrary, based upon the &amp;quot;prestige&amp;quot; of each tournament and the quality of players who have traditionally played in it. The subjectivism isn&#39;t quite as near to the surface as that of the college bowls, but it&#39;s still something that can have a notable, and perhaps unwarranted, effect upon the final results.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;algorithmic_rankings&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Algorithmic Rankings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kosteniuk.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Wcsrating_2&#34; title=&#34;Wcsrating_2&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wcsrating_2.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This brings us back to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system&#34;&gt;ELO system&lt;/a&gt;, a ranking system originally designed for chess which is fairly well-known and well-understood. As we said in our overview article, &amp;quot;[ELO] builds a simple distribution of player ratings around a norm (typically 1500 points), then awards or deducts points based upon wins and losses, with the total sum of all points in the system staying constant. Players are then ranked according to their comparative scores.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big difference between this and the previously discussed systems is that it&#39;s almost entirely objective; in fact it uses a statistical basis to create an underlying mathematical model for rankings, rather than allowing human subjectivity to get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest formulation for an ELO rating looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span size=&#34;+2&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&#39; = R + K * (S - E)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&#39;&lt;/code&gt; is the new rating&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is the old rating&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; is a maximum value for increase or decrease of rating (16 or 32 for ELO)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; is the score for a game&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; is the expected score for a game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the trick is in figuring out what the (&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;)xpected score of a game is. ELO uses the following formulas for players A and B:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;E(A) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [R(B) - R(A)] / 400 ) ]&lt;br /&gt;E(B) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [R(A) - R(B)] / 400 ) ]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a good model because, using the two formulas, it means that a great player gains little from beating an average player, but an average player gains a lot from beating a great player. Take the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;R(A) = 1900&lt;br /&gt;R(B) = 1500&lt;br /&gt;
E(A) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [1500 - 1900] / 400 ) ]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( -400 / 400) ]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ -4 / 4 ]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ -1 ]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 1 / 1 + .1&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = .91&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 91%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;E(B) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [1900 - 1500] / 400) ]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( 400 / 400 ) ]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ 1 ]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 1 / 11&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = .09&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = 9%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player A is expected to score .91 in an average game, which is to say he should win 91% of the time, and will be punished accordingly if he loses to player B:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;R&#39; = 1900 + 32 * (0 - .91)&lt;br /&gt;R&#39; = 1900 - 29.12&lt;br /&gt;R&#39; = 1871&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely a win nets him very little:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
R&#39; = 1900 + 32 * (1 - .91)&lt;br /&gt;R&#39; = 1900 + 32 * .09&lt;br /&gt;R&#39; = 1900 + 2.88&lt;br /&gt;R&#39; = 1903&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELO is almost entirely mathematical. Players can gain or lose different amounts of points based upon playing different players, but this is all part of the formula. The only slightly subjective element is the definition of &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; -- how much a player can win or lose from a particular game. The most widely used ELO systems for Chess break &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; down into two values: 16 for masters and 32 for everyone else. So there is a subjective decision that masters should vary their score less frequently than other players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a very minor element in an otherwise objective system, but as we&#39;ll see, more recent systems by Days of Wonder and Microsoft first reduce, then eliminate even this subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;days_of_wonder&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Variations of a Theme: Days of Wonder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.daysofwonder.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Dowlogo_1&#34; title=&#34;Dowlogo_1&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/dowlogo_1.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
ELO is probably the most used ranking system in the world. You can find it in use for Go, &lt;em&gt;Tantrix&lt;/em&gt;, and many other games. Days of Wonder, producers of &lt;em&gt;Gang of Four&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt;, and many other games use a variant of the system which they describe on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gangoffour.com/index.php?t=content&amp;amp;sub=ranking&#34;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They identify three core problems with ELO: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New players can take a long time to ascend or descend to their correct levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly ranked players can be hesitant to play with provisional players whose ranking might be much more uncertain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no allowances for games with more than two players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days of Wonder resolved the first problem by creating a new formula for provisional players, allowing them to rise and fall in the rankings much more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely when playing against provisional players, regular players can only lose a maximum of &lt;code&gt;K*n/20&lt;/code&gt; points, where n is the number of games that the provisional player has played--rather than the normal maximum loss of &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;. For example, playing someone who has just played one game, can only result in a loss of 1/20th of the regular &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; value, and so it really doesn&#39;t matter if the provisional player&#39;s ranking is wildly out of whack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these new formulas are set up to converge toward a normal ELO formula as a provisional player&#39;s number of games approaches 20 (making them a normal player at Days of Wonder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It should be pointed out that using the number &amp;quot;20&amp;quot; to define a provisional player, and making a player less provisional in clean 5% steps, inevitably offers yet another small, subjective element into this mathematical formula; as we&#39;ll see momentarily Microsoft has more recently incorporated the idea of provisional uncertainty into their core mathematical model, much as the whole ELO system originally turned subjective win and loss statistics into tighter mathematics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/games/wonder/TT/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ttrskotosrankings.png&#34; title=&#34;Ttrskotosrankings&#34; alt=&#34;Ttrskotosrankings&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Finally, to resolve the situation of multiple players, Days of Wonder considers each game to be a set of duels, as described here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
There are 4 players in a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gang of Four game. Let&#39;s name A the winning player, B the second one, C the third one and D the last one. We consider that there were 6 duels: A won against B, C and D. B won against C and D. C won against D. We compute independently the new scores for each duel, and then we average the values for each player&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a fairly elegant answer that not only rewards or penalizes all players separately, but also encourages playing for second place, or even third, if first isn&#39;t possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been continued discussions of the Days of Wonder ELO variant in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.daysofwonder.com/index.php?t=forums&#34;&gt;their forums&lt;/a&gt;, and the questions raised there are common to many different ranking systems. Some players wanted unranked games, while others thought that having unranked games would discourage people from playing good competitors &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; in unranked games.&amp;nbsp; There has also been a lot of discussion regarding &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt;, a strategy game that supports 2-5 people, and whether the ELO variant system discourages multiperson play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various lessons learned at Days of Wonder underline two basic ideas about rankings. First, even with a well-studied system like ELO, there&#39;s still a lot to understand, and, second, any ranking system needs to reflect the specifics of what it&#39;s ranking -- and what its purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;xbox_360_live&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Variations on a Theme: XBox 360 Live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/default.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Trueskillxbox360&#34; title=&#34;Trueskillxbox360&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/trueskillxbox360.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
An even more recent large-scale ranking system is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com/displayArticle.aspx?id=1361&#34;&gt;TrueSkill&lt;/a&gt; system developed by Microsoft for use with the XBox 360. It appears to be an expanded variant of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.bu.edu/people/mg/glicko/glicko.doc/glicko.html&#34;&gt;glicko&lt;/a&gt; ranking system used by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freechess.org/&#34;&gt;free internet chess server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the problems identified by Microsoft were the same as those already noted by Days of Wonder and others, including: the uncertainty of provisional ratings and the need to rank players in multiplayer games. However, the TrueSkill system notably expands both issues. Ranking uncertainty is now defined as a mathematical concept and the rankings now support not just multiple players, but also multiple teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/trueskill.gif&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=430,height=324,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Trueskill&#34; title=&#34;Trueskill&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/trueskill.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;TrueSkill explicitly includes two values in any ranking: a skill level and an uncertainty level. The first, like the more common ELO ranking, tells how good a player is. The second states how sure that ranking is. The uncertainty rating is effectively a margin of error, similar to those we saw in &lt;em&gt;polling systems&lt;/em&gt;. If a first-time player has a skill rating of 25 with an uncertainty rating of 8.3 that means that his skill is probably somewhere in the range of 16.7 to 33.3, a pretty wide range, but then this is a totally untested player. According to benchmarks that Microsoft produced, 99.99% of actual skill levels were within 3x of the uncertainty rating, and 100% were within 4x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of TrueSkill&#39;s innovations are built around this model of uncertainty. All players win or lose skill points, based upon how many players they beat or lose to, and they also decrease their uncertainty rating as they play more games. However, uncertainty is decreased more for players toward the middle of a pack within a game than those around the edges (because on the edges the players could actually be much better or much worse than it is possible to see from a specific game). In addition, TrueSkill is only a zero-sum ranking system for players at the exact same level of uncertainty. The more uncertainty that an opponent possesses, the smaller the weighting of any gain or loss (much like the simpler system that Days of Wonder uses, which bases weightings of games against provisional players as &lt;code&gt;n/20&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall TrueSkill is a somewhat complex system that is described more fully at Microsoft&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/Details.aspx#How_to_Update_Skills&#34;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;. Some of their expansions had already been considered by others, but still their system is notably innovative in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding a competitive ranking system to include concepts of teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating the uncertainty of ratings further into the core mathematical model, rather than using a somewhat more subjective model such as that described by Days of Wonder for provisional players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/RankCalculator.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/trueskillcalculator_1.png&#34; title=&#34;Trueskillcalculator_1&#34; alt=&#34;Trueskillcalculator_1&#34; class=&#34;image-full&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The TrueSkill calculations are a bit complex. In general, that&#39;s not a problem for a computer-based ranking model because you can have a computer doing all the computations, and players only need to understand the results. However the two-part ranking system used by TrueSkill, which notes both skill level and uncertainty, does offer a potential problem on this latter point. &lt;em&gt;Can players understand it?&lt;/em&gt; In general, the concept of uncertainty will not be understood by people other that statisticians, thus raising a real user-interface question with the TrueSkill system -- and the exact sort of thing that designers of new ranking systems will need to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;a_tale_in_the_desert&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Variations on a Theme: A Tale in the Desert&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atid.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;A_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1&#34; title=&#34;A_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/a_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The online game, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atitd.com&#34;&gt;A Tale in the Desert&lt;/a&gt;, identified a different problem with the ELO system: &lt;em&gt;cheating&lt;/em&gt;. This is a uniquely Internet-based problem, because there users can create fake accounts, then defeat those accounts to win points. This can also be done more subtly, by having multiple additional accounts build up the rating of that fake account before the fake account is defeated. So a totally new ranking system, called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.atitd.net/tale1/EGenesis_Ranking_System&#34;&gt;eGenesis Ranking System&lt;/a&gt;, was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each player is ranked through a 256-bit vector, half of which is initially set to 0 and half of which is set to 1 (therefore creating an average ranking of 128). Whenever a match occurs between players a hash function based on the players&#39; names mathematically selects 32 of those bits, 8 of which are then randomly selected. Among those bits, any 1s in the loser&#39;s vector which correspond to 0s in the winner&#39;s vector are &amp;quot;transferred&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple design corresponds in some ways to ELO&#39;s more complex formula. A good player will have more 1s and thus more to lose, and he will lose correspondingly more to a poor player who has more 0s in his vector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the system also prevents the collusion earlier noted. Statistically, a single player will only ever gain 8 ranking points from another new player, since out of the 32 bit hash only eight of those will, on average, be in the correct 0-1 configuration. Expanding a group of players expands the number of points that can potentially be gained, but within real limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wowsocialmap_1.png&#34; title=&#34;Wowsocialmap_1&#34; alt=&#34;Wowsocialmap_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
In fact, the eGenesis system prevents cheating by measuring the size of social networks, then limiting the number of ranking points that can be earned within a social network. It&#39;s not necessarily the only way to measure social network size, but its methodology points toward social software as an interesting area for additional study of ranking systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with XBox&#39;s TrueSkill, the eGenesis algorithms are overall fairly sophisticated and confusing, perhaps more so than TrueSkill itself. However, unlike TrueSkill the output is very simple: a skill number between 0 and 255. The intricacies are hidden by the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Competitive Ranking Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as we mentioned when discussing Days of Wonder, any ranking system has to be measured by what it&#39;s trying to do and how well it does that. ELO and similar numerical, long-term ranking systems, are most likely trying to achieve one of three goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;heirarchy&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchy:&lt;/strong&gt; Players are divided into hierarchies of success, giving players goals to constantly strive for and ways to measure their success (or failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;matching&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matching:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can play with other players at their same skill level, rather than having to play beginners or experts who are much better than they are. This generally increases everyone&#39;s enjoyment. For computer games, the complexity of a matching system can be largely moderated by the computer, thus ensuring better competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;handicapping&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handicapping:&lt;/strong&gt; If players do play against others of different skill levels, the better players can be handicapped in automatic, appropriate ways for the game in question, again increasing the fairness of games and everyone&#39;s enjoyment. For instance, someone ranked 3-kyu in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; playing a less experienced 7-kyu player would give him a starting &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_handicap&#34;&gt;4 stone advantage&lt;/a&gt; to make for better competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ELO system may be a good matching system, which allows players to easily find other players of their same skill level and play against them. However it doesn&#39;t provide any way to handicap players, nor would the ELO method necessarily be a good one to analyze handicaps (and conversely a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_handicap&#34;&gt;golf handicap&lt;/a&gt; might not do a good job of finding like players nor measuring players&#39; ability in a hierarchy). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently the XBox system has stated that it&#39;s explicitly for matchmaking, with the goal being to always try and match up players at nearly the same skill level. It&#39;s also used for hierarchy (or &amp;quot;leaderboards&amp;quot; as it&#39;s described in the TrueSkill docs), but that&#39;s clearly a subsidiary purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these systems would be ineffective for measuring a winner in a live event, which is a very different goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tourney:&lt;/strong&gt; A single player is listed as an absolute winner, the &amp;quot;King of the Hill&amp;quot;. Often, second, third, and fourth place winners are measured too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the systems we&#39;ve discussed thus far may not be useful for measuring privileges, yet another goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threshold:&lt;/strong&gt; The best ranks of players can be given special privileges, including the ability to create games and form tournaments. Alternatively, they can be given privileges totally outside the game, again giving them something extra to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these additional goals we may need to consider very different ranking systems, not just variations of ELO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;tourneys&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Different Themes: Tourneys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.kumc.edu/itc/staff/rknight/tourneys.htm&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Tournament_1&#34; title=&#34;Tournament_1&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/tournament_1.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
There are a number of well-known tournament types which can be used to create a &amp;quot;King of the Hill&amp;quot; ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament&#34;&gt;single-elimination tournament,&lt;/a&gt; where the winner of each competition moves on to compete with other winners, until there is only one. However, this style of tournament is quite cut-throat and is not suited very well to events where the competition may result in a draw, or where chance is a notable factor in the competition. It also has a very subjective factor in the initial &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament#Seeding&#34;&gt;seeding&lt;/a&gt; of the rounds. The single-elimination tournament also does not rank the losers. However, by having the losers compete with each other in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_system_tournament&#34;&gt;Swiss-style tournament&lt;/a&gt;, the relative strengths of the players can be ranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jsoo.home.mindspring.com/articles/formats/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/pseudodoubleelimination_1.png&#34; title=&#34;Pseudodoubleelimination_1&#34; alt=&#34;Pseudodoubleelimination_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
An improvement is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-elimination&#34;&gt;double-elimination tournament&lt;/a&gt; which is now one of the best known tournament systems in sports. Players compete in series of two-player matches, and a player has to lose twice before he&#39;s eliminated. This is done through a system of winner and loser brackets, wherein people drop from the winners&#39; brackets to the losers&#39; brackets when they lose once, and drop out altogether when they lose twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with standard double-elimination is that there are unusual situations where a significantly inferior player can still make it to the final round, or the last player to remain undefeated can lose only once and still be eliminated. These can be addressed through variants such as face-off (requiring the last two remaining competitors to compete &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; if the undefeated team is defeated for the first time in the finals) or by &lt;a href=&#34;http://jsoo.home.mindspring.com/articles/formats/&#34;&gt;reconfiguring the loser&#39;s brackets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wscgames.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Wsc_1&#34; title=&#34;Wsc_1&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wsc_1.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament&#34;&gt;Round-robin tournaments&lt;/a&gt;, such as official &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wscgames.com/2005/build/standing/1/topten.html&#34;&gt;Scrabble Tournaments&lt;/a&gt; involve every player playing a set number of games (24 in the 2005 World Scrabble Championship), facing opponents with similar win-lose records. They then ultimately rank players by their win-lose ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of these sorts of tournament over an ELO-style ranking is that they&#39;re easily understandable and seem fair. In addition, they measure ranking in a much more topical manner: how well someone is playing during a singular instant, rather than over a longer career. As a result they work much better for a live tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;thresholds&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Different Themes: Thresholds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed in our original article on Collective Choice, thresholds are ranking barriers above which members get a special ability--or alternatively levels below which members lose a special ability. They can also act as another goal for a ranking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usgo.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/gosmall.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Gosmall&#34; alt=&#34;Gosmall&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
In the game of Go there are both &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings#Pro_and_amateur_ranks&#34;&gt;amateur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings#Professional_strength&#34;&gt;professional&lt;/a&gt; players. Although they aren&#39;t technically in the same &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~mechner/go/kyu.html&#34;&gt;hierarchy of rankings&lt;/a&gt;, the highest Go amateur ranking&amp;nbsp; (7 dan) is approximately equal to the lowest Go professional ranking (1 dan), forming a de facto threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uschess.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/uscf_1.png&#34; title=&#34;Uscf_1&#34; alt=&#34;Uscf_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Likewise the United States Chess Federation uses their ELO rankings to denote &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_master&#34;&gt;Chess Masters&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who achieves 2200 UCSF is given a National Master threshold ranking and anyone who maintains it for 300 games is given a Life Master threshold ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acbl.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acblopt2_1.gif&#34; title=&#34;Acblopt2_1&#34; alt=&#34;Acblopt2_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acbl.org/&#34;&gt;American Contract Bridge Association&lt;/a&gt; uses a threshold system where you have to win a certain number of tournaments and thus earn &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acbl.org/about/honorTitles.html&#34;&gt;masterpoints&lt;/a&gt; in order achieve official rankings such as &amp;quot;section master&amp;quot;. Furthermore, players may earn different &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; of masterpoints depending the difficulty of the tournament, and some ranks require that you earn at least some specific colored masterpoints in order to meet the requirements for the next threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These thresholds are fairly explicitly based on other hierarchical ranking systems, but this doesn&#39;t need to be the case. Since determining the purpose of a ranking system is often the first step in designing it, as we delve further into the area of thresholds we may well find that systems specifically dedicated toward measuring thresholds are more likely to do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our next article we&#39;ll consider among other things the Avogadro reputation system, which manages thresholds in such a way as to prevent cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s actually a lot of variety in ranking systems, and even though we&#39;d like them to be totally objective, various subjective elements often creep into these systems. In addition, there&#39;s a lot of variety in what ranking systems can do. For competitive systems, hierarchy, privilege, matching, and handicapping are some of the top purposes of ranking. Determining what a ranking system is going to do is a necessary first step in designing the system, as different systems will accomplish various goals to a better or worse degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELO, in several variants, is the best studied and most used competitive ranking system. It works particularly well as a matching system. However, even ELO has flaws in it, among them: issues with new player rankings; its core two-player basis; its lack of provisions for teams; a few minor subjective elements; and problems with cheaters. New systems continue to be rolled out on the Internet to resolve these issues, and overall, it&#39;s an area of interesting new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tournament systems and threshold systems offer a few good examples of competitive ranking systems with very different purposes, underlying the need to understand what you&#39;re doing before you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking systems also lay very near yet another type of Collective Choice: reputation systems. We briefly addressed reputation systems when talking about threshold systems and will return to this in our next article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;A data point on ELO cheating for you: Yahoo! Games uses ELO rankings for several their two-player games. Before recent abuse mitigation changes, some people used robot to accumulate scores in excess of 6,000,000 points. The abuse-the-ranking game had become a totally seperate competition.
For now, Yahoo! has capped the ELO scores at 3,000 (I think.) This removed most of the cheating incentive.

What is also interesting to me is that it introduces a goal for ranking systems that I&#39;d not thought of before -- prediction. The purpose of the beatpath systems is actually focused on predicting the outcome the next set of the weekend games.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;There&#39;s a ranking scheme that Mark Newman from the U of Michigan did for college football, which Yahoo Search turned up a pointer to here:
http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20051112/mathtrek.asp
quoting:
Physicists Juyong Park and M.E.J. Newman aimed for a ranking system that&#39;s fast and easily understood by fans (in contrast to the cumbersome, opaque BCS formula). They based their ranking method on the notion that, if A beats B, and B beats C, then A also beats C, even if it may not actually play C. Hence, the method counts both direct wins by beating a team and indirect wins by beating a team that beat another team.
(end quote)
You end up with a directed graph of teams as nodes and games as edges, and compute a function of that graph that is related to a centrality metric.

I&#39;m working on the PvP ranking system for another game with some unique problems, because the teams in a PvP match can be of disparate size and widely differing power levels, which are then balanced so that wildly mismatched teams (ignoring relative rank at PvP for the moment) are actually reasonably matched.

It will be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml&#34;&gt;jointly posted&lt;/a&gt; in Shannon&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml&#34;&gt;Trials, Triumphs &amp;amp; Trivialities&lt;/a&gt; online games column at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/&#34;&gt;Skotos&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous article we talked about the many systems available for &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html&#34;&gt;collective choice&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#selection_systems&#34;&gt;selection systems&lt;/a&gt;, which are primarily centered on voting and deliberation, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#opinion_systems&#34;&gt;opinion systems&lt;/a&gt;, which represent how voting could occur, and finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#comparison_systems&#34;&gt;comparison systems&lt;/a&gt;, which rank or rate different people or things in a simple, comparative manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;128&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Stars_1&#34; title=&#34;Stars_1&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/stars_1.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One purpose of our previous article was to create a dictionary of terms for talking about these related, but clearly different, systems. Another was to start offering analyses of these systems, many of which had not been well studied before their introduction onto the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However at best our previous article provided an overview of what should be further investigated in each system. This article provides more in-depth coverage of one of the systems we previously outlined: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#rating_systems&#34;&gt;rating systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrote in our previous article, in comparison rating systems &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;the value of individual items (most frequently goods) rise or fall based upon the largely subjective judgment of individual users.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Ratings systems should be clearly differentiated from the closely related &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#ranking_systems&#34;&gt;ranking systems&lt;/a&gt;. Ratings systems have a more subjective component, while ranking systems are largely objective. Amazon, Netflix, BoardGameGeek, and even the Stock Market were offered up as examples of ratings systems. Another example of a comparison rating system, and one of the earliest that appeared on the modern Internet, is eBay. The techniques they use are now beginning to show their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;eBay: A Failed Rating Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Ebaysales&#34; title=&#34;Ebaysales&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebaysales.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;Most rating systems center around rating content, often user-contributed content, and they frequently help apply community values and acclaim to that content. However, the idea of ratings can go far beyond that narrow niche (though that will doubtless be its greatest use as the Internet continues to expand). Early Internet site, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ebay.com&#34;&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the first to widely use user-submitted ratings, and it used them for a different manner: to determine the good traders on their auction site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as one of the first in this field, eBay made many mistakes which now leave their ratings system only slightly helpful. However, its failures can also provide us with insights in creating new rating systems on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eBay allows you to leave positive, negative, or (more recently) neutral feedback for each transaction you conduct in their society. These are aggregated into two numbers. &amp;quot;Feedback Score&amp;quot; is calculated as unique positive feedback received minus unique negative feedback received, and results in a whole number like &amp;quot;32&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;10,302&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Positive Feedback&amp;quot; is calculated as positive feedback received divided by all feedback received, and results in a percentage like &amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;99.8%&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for reasons discussed below, almost all feedback is positive, and thus the Feedback Score acts almost entirely as a track record of how many trades someone has made. The Feedback Score could be largely replaced by that single number. You can look at a score of &amp;quot;27&amp;quot;, and say, &amp;quot;That&#39;s an amateur trader, or someone just getting started&amp;quot;, at a score of &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;, and say, &amp;quot;That person may or may not know what they&#39;re doing&amp;quot;, at a score of &amp;quot;10,302&amp;quot;, and say, &amp;quot;That person has done a lot of trades.&amp;quot; But you still don&#39;t know how good the trader is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Ebayprofile&#34; alt=&#34;Ebayprofile&#34; class=&#34;image-full&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Theoretically, the Positive Feedback percentage should give a more meaningful number, but people so infrequently give bad ratings that, even when they do appear, they look like noise. Does a percentage of &amp;quot;99.8%&amp;quot; on a user with a score of &amp;quot;1,762&amp;quot; mean that the seller has a genuine problem or not? Do those 3 unhappy customers really represent another 30 who were unwilling to actually click the negative feedback? And, did those people have slightly bad experience or really bad experiences? It&#39;s pretty hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, eBay has a few major problems with their rating system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;non-granular&lt;/strong&gt;, with only two options (positive/negative), or more recently three (positive/negative/neutral).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;non-distinct&lt;/strong&gt;, with no useful guidelines on what behaviors should result in each rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;non-statistical&lt;/strong&gt;, and thus ends up showing only a gross number of sales, not a real subjective measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;bilateral&lt;/strong&gt;, with buyers and sellers rating each other simultaneously, and thus people are afraid to give bad ratings lest they get them in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;meaningless&lt;/strong&gt;, because there are no good tools to control who bids on an auction based on Feedback numbers. (Technically it may be legitimate to ban low feedback bidders from an auction, then cancel their bids if they enter the auction, but this is neither obvious, automatic, nor simple.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re going to address each of these issues in turn, to offer insight into creating new comparison rating systems. The first three topics--granularity, distinction, and a statistical basis--are the most important elements of a good comparison rating system. Bilateral &amp;amp; meaningfulness issues will only be relevant on certain sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a final caveat: in some ways eBay falls closer in ultimate result to a &lt;em&gt;reputation system&lt;/em&gt;, a topic which we&#39;ll be covering more in a few articles down the road, but its lessons learned are still entirely accurate for rating systems of all sorts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Granular Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Smiley&#34; title=&#34;Smiley&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/smiley.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;
In general, &lt;em&gt;people want to be nice&lt;/em&gt;. There are exceptions to that rule, perhaps even great numbers of them, but the average, well-adjusted person would prefer to make other people happy, not sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a notable effect on any comparison rating system, because it means that people are less likely to use the bottom half of any rating scale. If you did a statistical run on eBay, you&#39;d certainly find that more than 99 out of every 100 ratings are positive. This is largely influenced by concerns of bilateral revenge, as discussed below, and the fact that eBay suggests other means of dispute resolution when you try and leave negative feedback. However, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpg.net&#34;&gt;RPGnet&lt;/a&gt;, a roleplaying site which reviews games, comics, books, movies, and more shows a similar trend despite the lack of bilaterality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPGnet uses two 5-points scales for reviews, resulting in a total rating of 2-10. Of all the ratings at RPGnet, 6,983 reviews have a total that&#39;s above average, a total rating of 6 or more, and 795 have a total that&#39;s below average, a total rating of 5 or less. Perhaps there are more people who sit down to write a review because they really like a game than those who do so because they really hated it, but the result of ~90% of reviews being above average is still stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table shows all the ratings for each of the two categories that RPGnet uses, &amp;quot;Style&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Substance&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9971.phtml&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Rpgnetsettlersreview&#34; title=&#34;Rpgnetsettlersreview&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/rpgnetsettlersreview.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 15px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;210&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;687&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;590&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1583&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23.8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3337&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3242&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;42.2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1554&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2153&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23.8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evidence confirms what we&#39;d already suspected. Only 10% of raters use the bottom two ratings in a 5-point scale, and only 2% use the bottom rating. The median of the 5-point scale is actually the fourth point, with a neat bell curve arranged around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because users are innately unwilling to give bad ratings, as evidenced here, useful comparison ratings truly come about only through fractional differences between good ratings. In this case, the difference between &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;4&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; is meaningful, and becomes more meaningful as more ratings are entered. Eventually you can look at a ranked list of ratings and see that &amp;quot;4.2&amp;quot; is a good rating while &amp;quot;3.5&amp;quot; is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, however, you need enough levels of good ratings to be able to distinguish between them. eBay, only offering one positive rating, does not provide enough differentiation. RPGnet, with its three positive ratings, might. However, sites that offer a 10-point scale are the ones that really seem to be able to produce meaningful statistics. On those sites we can expect that 90% of users will choose between six different numbers, from &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;, and as the number of ratings builds up, this will produce enough differentiation to be meaningful. If you have already adopted a 5-point scale, consider allowing users to select the half-points, giving users a greater ability to differentiate their ratings.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Distinct Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No two users are ever going to rate the same; different rating numbers will mean different things to each person. This can introduce minor discrepencies into ratings, if a single individual rates particularly low or high. However, because most ratings are eventually used for comparisons, if that low- or high-rater rates many different things, the ratings equalize. &amp;quot;Item A&amp;quot; is rated low by this person, but so is &amp;quot;Item B&amp;quot;, and so they end up in the correct positions &lt;em&gt;in relation to each other&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bigger problem occurs when an individual is inconsistent in his ratings over time. If an individual rates everything low for a while, then rates everything high, then he has a greater chance of biasing the overall rating pool. Worse, his individual ratings aren&#39;t meaningful, because you can&#39;t look at two items, see that one is a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; and another is an &amp;quot;8&amp;quot;, and truly believe that he likes the &amp;quot;8&amp;quot; a fair amount more than the &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;. This reduces the usability of an individual recommendation system or a friends system where one user might look at what other users thought about products, because their unaggregated numbers are not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You thus want to help individuals to stay consistent, and the best way to do that is to make the criteria for your ratings distinct. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boardgamegeek.com&#34;&gt;BoardGameGeek&lt;/a&gt;, a board game web site that supports a 10-point rating system for games, does a good job of offering distinction in its ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Settlers_rating_1&#34; title=&#34;Settlers_rating_1&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/settlers_rating_1.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; - Outstanding. Always want to play and expect this will never change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 &lt;/strong&gt;- Excellent game. Always want to play it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 &lt;/strong&gt;- Very good game. I like to play. Probably I&#39;ll suggest it and will never turn down a game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 &lt;/strong&gt;- Good game, usually willing to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 &lt;/strong&gt;- Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 &lt;/strong&gt;- Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 &lt;/strong&gt;- Not so good, it doesn&#39;t get me but could be talked into it on occasion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 &lt;/strong&gt;- Likely won&#39;t play this again although could be convinced. Bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 &lt;/strong&gt;- Extremely annoying game, won&#39;t play this ever again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -&lt;/strong&gt; Defies description of a game. You won&#39;t catch me dead playing this. Clearly broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you offer a distinct rating listing like this, some users will still come up with their own rating ideas, but if they do, they&#39;re more likely to remember what each number means to them. For everyone else, a very clear, s rating system is the most likely to produce meaningful and consistent results. As long as users aren&#39;t puzzled by the distinction, they&#39;ll be consistent in picking the same numbers for the same rating every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Statistical Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last big topic that you have to think about in creating most comparison rating systems is whether they&#39;re statistically sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to make your ratings statistically sound is with volume. If you can manage thousands or tens of thousands of ratings for each item, any anomolies are going to become noise. However, the fewer ratings you have, the more likely it is that your ratings are inaccurate in relationship to your database of ratings as a whole. (And thus one of the failures for eBay is that it tries to claim meaningfulness for users with very few ratings, where there&#39;s clearly no statistical basis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Bayes&#34; title=&#34;Bayes&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/bayes.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Ideally what you want to do is give items with fewer ratings among your collection less weight, and those with more ratings higher weight. One simple way to do this is to apply a &lt;em&gt;bayesian average&lt;/em&gt;. Variants of this are used by the aforementioned BoardGameGeek and by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com&#34;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;. RPGnet is using it for some unreleased software as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site, and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings. The basic formula looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; b(r) = [ W(a) * a + W(r) * r ] / (W(a) + W(r)]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; = average rating for an item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;W(r)&lt;/code&gt; = weight of that rating, which is the number of ratings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; = average rating for your collection&lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;W(a)&lt;/code&gt; = weight of that average, which is an arbitrary number, but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items; 100 is used here, for a database which expects many ratings per item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;b(r)&lt;/code&gt; = new bayesian rating &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say three &amp;quot;shill&amp;quot; users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a &amp;quot;10&amp;quot; because the producer asked them to. However, you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100, and thus 3 ratings won&#39;t move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;b(r) = [100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10] / (100 + 3)&lt;br /&gt; b(r) = 680 / 103&lt;br /&gt; b(r) = 6.60&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WowWebDesigns uses a similar model and even offers a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/formula.php&#34;&gt;good explanation of their methods&lt;/a&gt; on their web site.&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/designs/id_242/ratings/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wowwebdesignsrating.png&#34; title=&#34;Wowwebdesignsrating&#34; alt=&#34;Wowwebdesignsrating&#34; class=&#34;image-full&#34; halign=&#34;middle&#34; style=&#34;margin: 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything that&#39;s been described thus far, including granularity and distinction, a bayesian average (or some other similiar method) will probably be enough to give your ratings a good, sound statistical basis. However, sites with low volume of ratings may still be concerned with &amp;quot;shills&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;crappers&amp;quot; who come in to your site just to put &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;s on their favorite items on &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s on their least favorite. RPGnet&#39;s reviews are an example of a site that could experience this issue, because only a few people are going to ever write reviews for an individual item, and this small number of reviews could compromise the nature of any comparisons generated by the ratings sytems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short summary the following additional methods may help with this issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate the Raters:&lt;/strong&gt; Reviews are low volume, but presumably readers of those reviews are high volume, and you can take advantage of that to then have your readers rate the reviews. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netflix.com&#34;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; are two examples of sites which use this method by asking &amp;quot;how many readers found this helpful&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altruistic Punishment:&lt;/strong&gt; An alternative method for rating raters is to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html#altruistic_punishment&#34;&gt;altruistic punishment&lt;/a&gt;. Herein users can punish someone who does contribute to the community, but at a cost to themselves. So, a reader could flag a poor rating or a poor review at some minor cost to their own rating. Though this method may seems somewhat paradoxical, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory&#34;&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; suggests that it is a generally effective technique for improving the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust Ratings Based on Ratings:&lt;/strong&gt; Ratings can be self-adjusted based upon the rater&#39;s own behavior. The simplest method here is to map a rater&#39;s average rating to the average rating for a site. For example, if the average rating of a site is 6.50 and a shill&#39;s average rating is 10.0, then those 10s should be treated as 6.50s. This has the possibility for some intensive calculations, however, and may lead to additional bias in your rating pool if shills figure out the methods you use to adjust ratings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow Editorial Fiat:&lt;/strong&gt; Another method is to allow editorial fiat, where editors are expected to come in and remove bad ratings (or proactively not release them). This clearly results in time issues, but they may not be major since only sites with small numbers of ratings/item will have to do this type of adjusting. Further, automated systems could flag &amp;quot;suspicious&amp;quot; rating patterns which are outside the norms for average, speed of rating, etc. (RPGnet supports editorial fiat by requiring editorial release of all reviews.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of adjusting ratings based on ratings bears a bit of additional discussion because it&#39;s somewhat similar to another well-knowing rating system: slashdot. Herein you have both ratings and meta-ratings. People can rate threads and articles, then other people can agree or disagree with those ratings, which in turn makes it more or less likely that the original rater will be allowed to rate in the future (depending on if people agree or disagree with his ratings). Under a more general classification, this is probably a &lt;em&gt;meta-rating system based on a reputation system&lt;/em&gt;, so it&#39;s something we&#39;ll look at further a couple of articles down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Issues: Bilateralism &amp;amp; Usefulness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90% of the rating issues that sites will face are covered by the above. However eBay in particular raised two other issues -- bilateralism and usefulness -- that aren&#39;t as generally relevant but do deserve some consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Ebayfeedback&#34; alt=&#34;Ebayfeedback&#34; class=&#34;image-full&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Bilateralism:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the reasons that eBay&#39;s ratings fall apart is that they&#39;re bilateral. Buyers and sellers rate each other simultaneously and thus there&#39;s the fear of revenge if you rate someone badly. It&#39;s a sufficient issue that eBay has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pages.ebay.com/help/feedback/questions/retaliatory-feedback.html&#34;&gt;FAQ on the topic&lt;/a&gt;, though they don&#39;t offer any good answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following solution would address some issues of bilateral revenge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a time limit on bilateral ratings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release bilateral ratings simultaneously at the end of the time limit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t allow additional ratings after the time period&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would work well on an eBay, where you&#39;re unlikely to conclude an additional deal with someone you rated badly, and thus there&#39;s no possibility ever for rating revenge. On a game site, however, where people are arbitrarily put into games with each other, and thus you could end up in a game with someone you rated poorly, there might be room for later revenge, down the road. This would have to be addressed to truly feel comfortable with bilateral ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional investigation might reveal more variations of this method, or offer good answers for alternatives, like &lt;em&gt;anonymous ratings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, good privacy restrictions are really needed to make bilateral ratings work, as well as Terms of Service that protect users from lawsuits for ratings. There have already been cases of physical threats based upon eBay ratings. eBay has also produced cases where people threatened slander or libel lawsuits for bad ratings, and this even further chills the possibility of true ratings appearing on the eBay server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usefulness:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, you want to make sure your ratings are useful at your sites. Rankings are a good way to achieve this. You can see the &amp;quot;best games ever&amp;quot; ranked, or you can see the most interesting user content rise to the top of a long listing, and the least interesting sink to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eBay offers a counter example of frustration with the usefulness of ratings. As already mentioned, you can theoretically ban &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; users from bidding on your items, and then cancel bids from these users if they appear. However, there are multiple issues with this approach. First, how do you define &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; users on eBay? Insufficient feedback? Too much negative feedback? Too high a percentage of negative feedback? Second, there is no automated method for doing this, so you must remain ever vigilant on your auctions to make sure that &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; users aren&#39;t involved. Third, there&#39;s no way to keep a bad bidder from returning after you&#39;ve cancelled his bid. Fourth, these bad bids and cancellations have the possibility of corrupting your auction, as you could lose other bidders who came in, saw the higher bid when the bad bidder was involved, then left before the bid was reduced by his removal. Finally, greed is a powerful motivator on eBay, which might lead to the retention of bad users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need to be careful with your user interface for ratings. Here is an example of a poor UI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/uselessratingui.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Uselessratingui&#34; alt=&#34;Uselessratingui&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison ratings are going to be an increasingly important force as the Internet continues to mature. To produce meaningful comparison ratings for your site, you need to concentrate on four important factors: granularity, specifity, sound statistics, and usefulness. And, if you offer bilateral ratings, make sure you understand the subtleties of that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve ran into my fair share of voting systems, but by far the worst I&#39;ve ever seen is the one used at www.animenfo.com, a database of anime products with user ratings. When giving a product a rating, a user is required to also write a constructive review on the product. However, the reviews are moderated and, often, removed from the database as &#34;unconstructive&#34; by the limited number of moderators. The problem with this approach is that the moderators are inevitably biased. A submitted, bad rating on a product, if reviewed by a moderator who personally likes the show being rated, is often removed from the database with the claim that the review was not constructive. Perhaps not entirely related, but an example of ratings-gone-awry, all the same.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;It&#39;s rarely used, but asking people to rank from -5 to +5 can be better than ranking from 0 to 10.   You make it very clear that &#34;0&#34; means average/neutral.   You won&#39;t entirely eliminate the positive bias in ratings but you can reduce it.  And you bring everybody closer to the same mean.
I&#39;ve concluded over time that in fact the response to a negative feedback on eBay should be disabled, as it contains no information.   Who, after all, is going to give a positive feedback to somebody after they have slapped a negative on you?  The likely choices there are no-feedback or neutral from a charitable person and of course a revenge negative.
So they could make it simpler.  If the first person gives a negative, the transaction is considered sour.  In your stats it would list the number of first-negatives you left for others.  (The number of negs you leave for others is already visible but harder to find.)  Ideally split buyer/seller.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;An interesting point missing from this good summary:
Many huge ratings sites see a clear bimodal distribution of scores when rating products(movies, cds, books, etc.)  with a simple scoring scheme, such as a single 5-star scale: The nodes are at 1 and 5 stars, with the love-or-hate scores making up more than 80% of all scores.
Clearly, some of that is a function of the intrinsic cost vs. incentive structures of completing ratings and reviews. When there is a clear direct benifit to the user (such as Netflix, Slashdot, or Yahoo! Music&#39;s Launchcast) ratings tend to distribute a bit more evenly (but just a bit.)
My point is that the actual end-user application of the rating has a large effect on the nature of the scores that will be created.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I find when people give a bad rating on anything from eBay to those hotel and restaurant review sites its usually as a result of an extremely negative personal experience therefore the rating tends to be exagerated and totally not objective.
A blind system like the porposed solution to eBay bilateralism issue is probably best.
I&#39;ve been a mystery shopper for a handful of restaurants and the system works quite well. In this system the purpose is to behave exactly like a regular consumer. You sit down, ask about the specials, take mental note of everything from the bathroom sink to the temperature of the food (and a hundred other details), but you don&#39;t behave in any way that would alter the staff you are a mystery shopper (for example writing things down is strickly prohibited).
Upon returning home you complete a lengthy questionnare about all the details you were supposed to notice. In this system the rewards is for a thorough assesment, regardless of its positive or negative slant. The more detail you provide the better assignments you get next time around. Even if you totally slam a place, but you provide substantial detail, you will be &#34;promoted&#34; to a &#34;bar visit&#34; or something much more rewarding than the typical lunch visit. So, I also agree with this articles suggestion to rate the raters, akin to what Amazon does but without the bias towards volume.
I would also addd that there is no middle ground on such ratings. Whether the choices range from Strongly Agree to Strongly Dissagree, or from &#34;shortest wait&#34; to &#34;longest wait&#34; there is no &#39;neutral&#39; choice, nothing is &#34;just right&#34; as in the story about the three bears and the porridge. Even with numerical choices they are always even, not odd, so there is not chance of ranking in the middle. I like that. I think it pushes you to be more realistic. Having a middle ground leaves the undecided the opportunity to not make a decision. A &#34;middle&#34; rating is of no use to anyone.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Good work there, and very thorough. Can we distinguish the social/transactional from the object/informational aspects of a rating situation? I&#39;m just wondering aloud. On the one hand is the fact that publishing one&#39;s rating of a transaction will reflect on the transaction partner, on oneself, and so is social. On the other hand is the fact one can indeed rate an experience with some objectivity, assuming that the soft stuff has been bracketed out. I dont see how we can bracket out the social though, at least in a way that users will be able to participate in.
There&#39;s a thing about sincerity as a type of interaction: it&#39;s an attribute of expression that cannot be stated explicitly (say that you&#39;re being sincere and you throw your sincerity into quesion immediately). Ratings may fall into that kind of category of linguistic and metalinguistic acts..

Wow, thorough and cogent.
Of all of the points, one missed opportunity occured to me while reading, and that is on the EBay statistical validity criticism. The phrase &#39;thus one of the failures for eBay is that it tries to claim meaningfulness for users with very few ratings, where there&#39;s clearly no statistical basis&#39; struck me as off.
Human transactions are not mechanical actions - they involve situations that often matter. Hence a particular negative may really be cause for serious concern, even if there are not yet many ratings. Also, beginners are not inherantly less important than experienced traders. So though difficult, credit, or blame, is rightly awarded even on the basis of just a few transactions. Exactly how is a subject of further refinement.
I have read some of the EBay dissection papers a while back. This post is far more comprehensive, that is wide ranging, and yet not missing clarity, accuracy or nuance. Master work.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 0.7em;&#34;&gt;by Christopher Allen &amp;amp; Shannon Appelcline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline&#34;&gt;[Shannon Appelcline&lt;/a&gt; is a friend and colleague of mine at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net&#34;&gt;Skotos&lt;/a&gt;, an online game company. Over the last few years we&#39;ve had many discussions about how decisions are made, and how our society collectively makes choices. The origin of these discussions have varied from &amp;quot;what makes this board game work?&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;how can we give our players more control of our online games?&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;how do we make decisions in our company?&amp;quot;, and of course &amp;quot;how did we collectively make such a mess of decision making in America?&amp;quot;. This article, and some followup articles, summarize our thoughts on these topics, and will be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_178.phtml&#34;&gt;jointly posted&lt;/a&gt; in Shannon&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml&#34;&gt;Trials, Triumphs &amp;amp; Trivialities&lt;/a&gt; online games column at Skotos.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Peoplearoundthesun&#34; title=&#34;Peoplearoundthesun&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/peoplearoundthesun.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt; Collective choice systems have been around for a long time. Since at least the birth of democracy in ancient Greece people have made joint decisions about important issues, and since at least the knightly tournaments of the late Middle Age people have competed to be ranked against their peers. Today Western culture especially values diversity of input when implementing any type of choice, believing that wide input from a variety of people provides the fairest result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet expands this long history of collective choice. However, as we bring collective choice systems onto the Internet, quantifying and programming them, we discover the need to be more analytical and more methodical in the techniques used. Thus we&#39;re beginning to learn that we don&#39;t know nearly as much about these collective choice systems as we should. There is a need to analyze and study them further, to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to evaluate their social impact. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html&#34;&gt;social software&lt;/a&gt; and online games on the Internet provides the perfect &lt;em&gt;petri dish&lt;/em&gt; for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before any analysis can occur, however, there is a need for a categorization of systems and a definition of terms. That is the purpose of this article: to lay out at least some of the ways in which collective choices can be made, to organize them, to define them, and to briefly consider them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, there seem to be three methods of collective choice, divided by the intended result: &lt;em&gt;selection&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;comparison&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;selection_systems&#34;&gt;Selection Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selection systems allow for the purposeful choice between multiple items. There are many types of selection systems, but two in particular, &lt;em&gt;representative systems&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;deliberative systems&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;consensus systems&lt;/em&gt; are worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;

They&#39;re by definition &lt;em&gt;voting systems&lt;/em&gt; and the heart of any &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism&#34;&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; system of government. When you&#39;re voting for a president, prime minister, senator, congressman, director, or board member, that&#39;s representative voting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most representative voting a winner is selected by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality&#34;&gt;plurality&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the winner had more votes than any other candidate. This works well in a simple two-member election, but begins to fall apart if there are multiple candidates, because similar candidates can steal votes from each other, and thus allow a candidate with less popular ideas to be elected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest solution is to require a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority&#34;&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; victory, meaning that one winner must have at least 50% of the votes. Some places in the United States use this system for their representative elections, holding a first election, eliminating all but the two biggest vote-getters, then holding a new election between these two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election&#34;&gt;primary-based election system&lt;/a&gt;, wherein all like-minded candidates compete against each other before participating in the real election. This requires buy-in from all like-minded candidates, however, and recent U.S. elections with third-party candidates like Ralph Nader and Ross Perot show the flaws in a voluntary primary system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other types of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_systems&#34;&gt;voting systems&lt;/a&gt; are possible, most of which allow voters to select multiple candidates at the same time. These systems then eliminate the lowest ranked candidates and give their votes to others based upon those voter selections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/irv.gif&#34; title=&#34;Irv&#34; alt=&#34;Irv&#34; style=&#34;margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRV&#34;&gt;Instant Runoff Voting&lt;/a&gt;, or IRV, is a fairly commonly used multiple candidate system (though not necessarily the best one). It&#39;s technically a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Transferable_Vote&#34;&gt;single transferable vote&lt;/a&gt; preferential voting system. Wikipedia describes the process like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each voter ranks at least one candidate in order of preference.&lt;br /&gt; ...&lt;br /&gt; First choices are tallied. If no candidate has the support of a majority of voters, the candidate with the least support is eliminated. A second round of counting takes place, with the votes of supporters of the eliminated candidate now counting for their second choice candidate. After a candidate is eliminated, he or she may not receive any more votes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This process of counting and eliminating is repeated until one candidate has over half the votes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s simple to understand, but also flawed. That&#39;s because every voting system ultimately has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow&#39;s_impossibility_theorem&#34;&gt;flaw&lt;/a&gt; in it, as is evidenced by the fact that given the same conditions the different systems will often declare different winners. Different systems may also allow voters to &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; the system in different ways. This is often called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting&#34;&gt;tactical voting&lt;/a&gt; or strategic voting. Similar to analyzing various &amp;quot;attacks&amp;quot; when studying a cryptosystem, looking at which tactical voting approaches each voting system is vulnerable to helps you evaluate the voting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, one type of tactical voting that can be used against an Instant Runoff Vote is the push-over strategy, which Wikipedia describes as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Push-over is a type of strategic voting in which a voter ranks a perceived weak alternative higher, but not in the hopes of getting it elected. This primarily occurs in runoff voting when a voter already believes that his favored candidate will make it to the next round - the voter then ranks an unpreferred, but easily beatable, candidate higher so that his preferred candidate can win later. A United States analogy would be voters of one party crossing over to vote in the other party&#39;s primary to nominate a candidate who will be easy for their favorite to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in an IRV election between Bush, Gore, and Nader, Democrats might rank Nader over Bush. The hope would be that this would give Nader enough votes to keep him from being eliminated, thus knocking Bush out instead in the first round. Afterward the Republican Bush votes transfer to the less progressive Gore, rather than the fringe Nader, allowing Gore to beat the &amp;quot;pushover&amp;quot; Nader when they couldn&#39;t have faced Bush in a straight-up fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There several different tactical voting &amp;quot;attacks&amp;quot; against various representative voting systems. One of the technically better multiple-candidate voting methods is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method&#34;&gt;condorcet method&lt;/a&gt; for voting. It&#39;s immune to most tactical voting strategies and more people would consider its result &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;, but unfortunately it is much harder on the voters, who have to rank every single candidate. Maybe if we can create a better Internet user-interface to condorcet voting we can make this more sophisticated representative voting system more broadly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;deliberative_systems&#34;&gt;Deliberative Systems:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In a deliberative system, individuals directly make a decision, rather than selecting a representative to do so. Deliberative systems do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have to include voting, and the subcategory of &lt;em&gt;consensus systems&lt;/em&gt; described below technically don&#39;t, however most modern deliberative sytems do. A deliberative system is the heart of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEMOCRACY&#34;&gt;true democracy&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally it&#39;s been relatively unfeasible because voters were not expected to be educated enough to make governmental decisions and because they didn&#39;t have the time or capability to regularly decide on issues. The spread of the Internet alleviates at least the latter problem, since millions of people can now simultaneously decide on any issue if they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States the best known deliberative system is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative&#34;&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; system found in some states, including California. It allows for issues to be put directly before the voters through the submission of sufficient signatures, and then allows the voters to pass or fail those issues, based on either &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality&#34;&gt;plurality&lt;/a&gt; (most votes), &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority&#34;&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; (at least 50% of votes), or else &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority&#34;&gt;super majority&lt;/a&gt; (some percentage of votes in excess of 51%). In California, for example, 66% approval is required for new tax initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/constitution_signing.jpg&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=540,height=350,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;129&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Constitution_signing&#34; title=&#34;Constitution_signing&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/constitution_signing.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The United States constitution defines a large and very complex deliberative system. It creates three bodies of government to support deliberation and voting, and uses a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checks_and_Balances#Checks_and_balances&#34;&gt;checks and balances&lt;/a&gt; systems in order to allow different branches to have different effects upon a vote. The main voting is done by the legislature, which requires two &lt;em&gt;pluralities&lt;/em&gt; from two different groups of people to pass a vote. Then the executive branch has a singular opportunity to veto legislature, which then requires a &lt;em&gt;super majority&lt;/em&gt; (here, 66%) to override that veto. Once a law is established, the judicial department may by &lt;em&gt;plurality&lt;/em&gt; vote to declare that legislation unconstitutional, but that may be overcome by an even greater &lt;em&gt;super majority&lt;/em&gt; (typically, 66% of each legislature + 75% of the state governments) who want to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution#Provisions_for_amendment&#34;&gt;amend the constitution&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitution also shows how deliberation can span beyond simple voting because of the fact that it includes specific rules for how to debate, when debate can be closed, etc. In today&#39;s very fractured congress, however, it&#39;s unclear if individuals ever are actually swayed by deliberations in the floor of the legislature, or if they&#39;ve already decided to follow their party lines or their specific interests, long before they entered the Capitol buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smaller example of a true deliberative system, based on guiding discussions as much as holding votes, is found in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robertsrules.org/&#34;&gt;Robert&#39;s Rules of Order&lt;/a&gt;, a guide for conducting meetings. These rules detail explicit methods not just for voting, but also for the deliberation and discussion surrounding the voting. Various &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;minority&lt;/em&gt; votes can be taken to allow for certain actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because deciding directly upon ideas rather than just voting for representatives can have a greater effect upon a community, the deliberative systems may need to be more complex to avoid abuse, as evidenced by the complexities of the U.S. Government and Robert&#39;s Rule of Order. However, these very complexities can make these systems more prone to purposeful gaming. The benefits and deficits of more complex deliberative systems have not yet been fully studied, nor have there been as much analysis of &amp;quot;attacks&amp;quot; against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/consensus_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;141&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/consensus_1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Consensus_1&#34; alt=&#34;Consensus_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;consensus_systems&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;consensus_systems&#34;&gt;Consensus Systems:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In consensus systems people jointly come to a consensus as a group through group interactions. This sort of decision making theoretically avoids the &amp;quot;tyranny of the majority&amp;quot; and likewise can produce more informed decision making. It&#39;s a variant of the broader &lt;em&gt;deliberative systems&lt;/em&gt;, but one with more group and less individual power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of consensual selection is cabinet government as laid out under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system&#34;&gt;Westminster System&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia describes it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Members of the Cabinet are collectively seen as responsible for government policy. All Cabinet decisions are made by consensus, a vote is never taken in a Cabinet meeting. All ministers, whether senior and in the Cabinet, or junior ministers, must support the policy of the government publicly regardless of any private reservations. If a minister does not agree with a decision he, or she, can resign from the government; as did several British ministers over the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. This means that in the Westminster system of government the cabinet always collectively decides all decisions and all ministers are responsible for arguing in favour of any decision made by the cabinet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Quaker-based_consensus&#34;&gt;Quaker-based consensus&lt;/a&gt; offers a similar example. Herein a facilitator helps to identify disagreements and agreements to move a discussion forward until an end result is embraced by all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, it&#39;s important to differentiate consensus from coercion. The end result of unanimity isn&#39;t the sole definition of a consensus system, nor is it entirely required. What is required is a more open and thoughtful selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;opinion_systems&#34;&gt;Opinion Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Poll&#34; title=&#34;Poll&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/poll.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;Opinion systems are a clear subsidiary category to selection systems. An opinion system&#39;s main use is as a decision indicator, to show how people will decide or did decide in a representative system, a deliberative system, or both. Current opinion systems tend to be oriented toward actual votes, as opposed to more freeform selection systems (though the &lt;em&gt;delphic polling system&lt;/em&gt; shows a more freeform version of the category itself). Opinion systems tend to be push-based (meaning people are asked for their opinions rather than actively offering them), but this isn&#39;t required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All opinion systems tend to have the same general problem, which is figuring out how to use scientific means to determine the actual results of a decision. This means massaging respondent numbers to offset categories of people more or less likely to vote to try and generate the actual results. For example, one 1998 poll showed that 62% of Republicans were absolutely certain they were going to vote, while only 51% of Independents could say the same. This means that every Republican voter a poll contacted in that year might have been weighted about 1.2x over every Independent contacted. Of course the actual calculations are much more complex than that, since they tend to depend upon traditional voter turnout and lots of analysis, but the core idea is sound, which is that every polled individual should &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; be considered equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All opinion system results tend to be rated with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error&#34;&gt;margins of error&lt;/a&gt;. The margin of error is a percent spread which the poll is expected to be within, 90-99% of the time (depending on how conservative of a confidence rating is given). If a poll shows that a politician is expected to take 48% of the vote, for example, and the margin of error is 4%, that means he is expected to take 44-52% of the vote with 90-99% surety. Margins of error are typically given much greater importance in the modern media than they should, as they&#39;re calculated solely based upon the total number of respondents to a poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two general categories of opinion systems: &lt;em&gt;pre-voting (subjective) polling systems&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;post-voting (objective) polling systems&lt;/em&gt;. A different type of opinion system, &lt;em&gt;delphic polling&lt;/em&gt;, which could apply to either pre- or post-voting systems is also covered. Polling systems not directly related to selection systems are covered later, as &lt;em&gt;subjective rating systems&lt;/em&gt;, since they tend to have issues very different from other polling systems, as their goal isn&#39;t to try and match the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; number of an actual vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;pre-voting_polling_systems&#34;&gt;Pre-voting Polling Systems:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These are polls made before a vote is cast. They&#39;re often called &amp;quot;opinion polls&amp;quot; and tend to be conducted via phone. They try and isolate &amp;quot;likely voters&amp;quot; and determine how they will vote. This question of voter likelihood is one of the first issues with a pre-voting system, because there&#39;s no guarantee that the polled people will actually later vote. Likewise, pre-voting systems have to accommodate &amp;quot;undecided voters&amp;quot; and the fact that no voter has ever truly made up their mind until they cast their final ballot. Unlike post-voting polling systems, pre-voting systems also have considerable more possibility for bias (which is not accounted for by margins of error), based upon how questions are asked, in what order, and with what additional text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Exitpoll&#34; title=&#34;Exitpoll&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/exitpoll.png&#34; style=&#34;margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;post-voting_polling_systems&#34;&gt;Post-voting Polling Systems:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These are polls taken after a vote is cast. They&#39;re typically called &amp;quot;exit polls&amp;quot;, as most are conducted as people are leaving a &amp;quot;polling&amp;quot; station (where they cast a vote). One would expect these to be much more reliable than pre-voting polls, but as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities#Exit_polls&#34;&gt;2004 U.S. Presidential Election&lt;/a&gt; showed, exit polls can be wildly inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with post-voting polling systems, shared with pre-voting systems, is that the results must be manipulated to make sure that respondents to the poll match the percentages of those constituencies in the overall populations. For example, in the 2004 exit polls it appears that women were initially overrepresented in exit polls, and because of increased black turnout it appears that blacks were underrepresented in the exit polls. It can easily be seen how either of these misrepresentations could cause notable changes in an exit poll result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When conducted &amp;amp; matched correctly, exit polls are supposed to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy%2C_exit_polls#Reliability_of_Exit_Polls&#34;&gt;quite reliable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/delphiamphitheatre.jpg&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=458,height=317,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;138&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Delphiamphitheatre&#34; title=&#34;Delphiamphitheatre&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/delphiamphitheatre.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;delphic_polling_systems&#34;&gt;Delphic Polling Systems:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; An interesting polling method applicable to all sorts of opinion systems is the &amp;quot;delphi poll&amp;quot;. This is a specific method of polling which is &lt;em&gt;iterative&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt; and which supports &lt;em&gt;confidence ratings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;feedback&lt;/em&gt;. The general idea is that people are polled on a question using not just binary responses, but a full confidence rating (e.g., you would state that you are 60% sure that Bush would be elected, rather than stating that you think Bush would be elected). After polls are collected, the anonymous results--or at least a summary of those results--are shared with the participants, who then poll again. This iterative process continues until a consistent answer is settled upon. By incorporating feedback into the polling process there&#39;s the possibility for greatly increased reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways delphic polling systems can be seen as an analogy to &lt;em&gt;consensus systems&lt;/em&gt;, since both involve more iterative processes that eventually result in a more commonly-held decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;comparison_systems&#34;&gt;Comparison Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison systems allow individual items to be measured up against each other. There are three general categories: &lt;em&gt;comparison ranking systems&lt;/em&gt;, which are largely objective and which typically rank people; and &lt;em&gt;comparison rating systems&lt;/em&gt;, which more often mix subjective and objective opinions, and which more frequently rate things; and &lt;em&gt;reputation rating systems&lt;/em&gt;, which again tend to rank people, but also have a subject and objective mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;ranking_systems&#34;&gt;Comparison Ranking Systems:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In a ranking system, items in a hierarchy (most frequently people) rise or fall based upon specific, objective, and well-known rules. This is the heart of most multiplayer competitive systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=500,height=336,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/chess.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;134&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/chess.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Chess&#34; alt=&#34;Chess&#34; style=&#34;margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system&#34;&gt;ELO System&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a ranking system used for two-player games, and is used by the U.S. Chess Federation. Days of Wonder uses a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gangoffour.com/index.php?t=content&amp;amp;sub=ranking&#34;&gt;multiplayer variant of the ELO system&lt;/a&gt; for their online games. Each system builds a simple distribution of player ratings around a norm (typically 1500 points), then awards or deducts points based upon wins and losses, with the total sum of all points in the system staying constant. Players are then ranked according to their comparative scores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are flaws in ranking systems like ELO. For example, two players could collude, with one purposefully throwing games so that his opponent could increase his ranking. Alternatively if a player gets a few lucky victories against good opponents, his rating might temporarily skyrocket above its normative value. However, these tend to be well-known and well-researched problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are numerous other ranking systems which are used for competitions, from double-elimination seeded tournaments (e.g., a tennis tournament) to ranked comparisons based upon win-loss ratios (e.g., baseball standings). Objective rankings are also (less commonly) used to rank items, such as a ranking of cars based upon safety ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/usmc_enlisted_rank_structure.jpg&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=476,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;148&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Usmc_enlisted_rank_structure&#34; title=&#34;Usmc_enlisted_rank_structure&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/usmc_enlisted_rank_structure.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most ranking systems create a hierarchy of positive rankings (e.g., &amp;quot;best chess players ever&amp;quot;). However, a hierarchy of negative rankings may also most be used, most commonly based on a negative criteria (e.g., &amp;quot;biggest Player Killers (PKers)&amp;quot;). In addition, either direction of ranking can use threshold systems to mark positive or negative rankings that meet a certain criteria. A positive threshold might be a &amp;quot;Grand Master&amp;quot; ranking threshold for anyone with a Chess rating of 2700, while a negative threshold might be a &amp;quot;Player Killer&amp;quot; ranking threshold, for with sufficient &amp;quot;accidental&amp;quot; PKs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking systems are somewhat removed from the other collective choice systems listed here, since there&#39;s isn&#39;t a collaborative decision, only a collective result. However their problems &amp;amp; results remain closely related to the more collective rating and reputation systems, hence their inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netflix.com&#34;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; are two examples of stores which provide subjective rating systems. Individual users rate items from 1 to 5 stars, then an average user rating is calculated. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boardgamegeek.com&#34;&gt;BoardGameGeek&lt;/a&gt; offers a slightly different example because it not only lets users rate individual items, but also ranks items against each other based upon those ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flaws in these systems are similar to those in ranking systems: low numbers of ratings producing bad rankings, and individual users purposefully biasing ratings. Some mathematical methods may be used to smooth out these issues, among them &lt;em&gt;bayesian averages&lt;/em&gt;, which give ratings weight based upon total number of ratings for an item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stock Market offers an example of a different sort of rating system, because there&#39;s theoretically some objective basis to it. In a perfect Stock Market system, stock prices are based upon a solid cost analysis, such as a multiplier on yearly revenues or profits. However, as the Internet bubble of the late 1990s conclusively showed, there&#39;s also a high irrational component to stock purchases: thus subjective and objective views are combined in the rating (cost) of a stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;reputation_systems&#34;&gt;Reputation Systems:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, reputation systems are very similar to ranking systems: items in a hierarchy (most frequently people) rise or fall based upon specific and well-known rules. However, unlike true ranking systems, reputation systems instead base their rules for rise and fall upon other user feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of a reputation system is ultimately to create a trust metric that often allows different users access to different powers. We&#39;ll be covering reputation systems a bit more thoroughly in a couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of ways to measure the collective choices of a large group of people. We&#39;ve outline nine here: representative, deliberative, and consensus selection systems; ranking, rating, and reputation comparison systems; and three varieties of opinion systems. When developing social software it is important to understand the difference between these broad categories of systems and to use lessons already learned from the appropriate category in your own social software designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;My intent was more to outline the broad categories of collective choice, then to give all the possible examples within each category. Both consensus methods and facilitated decision making processes fall under the &#34;deliberation systems&#34; category.
It is my hope in future articles to dig deeper into each broad category and show more examples of types. Next week hopefully will be comparison rating systems.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve made some changes to this blog entry, adding consensus systems under deliberation systems, added reputation systems as a type of opinion system, simplifying some of the category names, and added some links.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;This is an excellent summary, but I feel like I want a comparison table of some kind.
Would &#34;information futures market&#34; or the like be a Delphic system? It sure seems more like a consensus measuring device to me.
One of the most interesting things about all of these systems is the side effects they have on the decisions made. Binary Votes polorize options. Information Futures Markets encourage results manipulation (by design!)

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;This is a wonderful overview.  Thank you for putting it together!
I&#39;d like to suggest one small correction to the description of Condorcet voting, which says &#34;it is much harder on the voters, who have to rank every single candidate&#34;.  In a Condorcet system, the voters don&#39;t have to rank every candidate; they can rank as many or as few as they want (just like IRV), and they can even rank candidates equally (unlike IRV).  The Wikipedia article entitled &#34;Condorcet method&#34; describes this.
Regarding a comparison of these systems, i&#39;ve tried to illustrate the behaviour of plurality, approval, IRV, and Condorcet elections at http://zesty.ca/voting/ , and i hope you will find my method and results interesting.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;The problem of choice is outline very well in the book &#39;The Paradox of Choice&#39; by Bary Schwartz.  It provides a great description of some of the other challenges of multi-party elections. I found it very interesting when it got into the psychology of choice regret, and alternative choices.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I agree this is a very interesting article!  I notice an (intentional?) lack of coverage of most of the dominant and mature decision-making institutions in our society: markets in general (and specifically institutions such as exchanges -- mentioned briefly -- auctions, fixed-price retail stores vs. haggling bazaars, and so on), risk sharing institutions (e.g. insurance), hierarchical organizations based on the employer-employee and boss-subordinate relationships, the judiciary based on written law, opinion, and precedent, and so on.  Of course, it would be very ambitious to tackle these, but it would at least be interesting to try to categorize them according to your taxonomy.  Perhaps they are so complex they often fall into multiple categories.
The systems you describe abstract a vast amount of diffuse and often tacit information pertinent to a decision into a numerical result. Most economists (particularly Austrian school) would argue that at least on a large scale prices generated by auctions and exchanges generally do this better than other collective decision making systems.  On the other hand, many systems for collective choice don&#39;t work via an abstract numerical intermediary (e.g. the opinion and precedent system of the judiciary).
I suggest that the most important factor in these institutions is the costs involved in eliciting diffuse knowledge and lossily compressing it into a decision which is hopefully nevertheless a reasonably accurate reflection of that diffuse information.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;At least part of the reason why I didn&#39;t strongly highlight markets is that the definition of &#34;collective choice&#34;, at least as far as how many academics use it, is all the methods that groups make decisions EXCEPT markets. For instance, from http://www.bsos.umd.edu/umccc/ &#34;models of individual rational choice behavior to study non-market social phenomena&#34;.
However, another definition is http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~polisci/calvert/PolSci505/ &#34;social choice theory and noncooperative game theory&#34;, and I might say that markets fall into a subset of noncooperative game theory.
Personally I&#39;m not sure why most academics exclude markets, thus I do briefly mention the Stock Market as a subcategory of comparison system. I hope to mention them more in other future articles, in particular, prediction markets as a subcategory of Polling Systems.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Will you cover, in a future post the forced choice vote? I&#39;d welcome learning about more ways that a group can discuss alternatives (online or in person) then either vote in a priority way (first choice, second choice, etc.)
and/ or choose to vote in a first round for &#34;x&#34; number of options then limit the conversation to those options, then perhaps do a forced choice vote.
In other words what are some hybrid methods that you
(amazing) Christopher might craft that combine:
A. Thoughtful conversation to hear all ideas/opinions -
without the downsides of :
• being prolonged to the point it pains participants
and/or
• being dominated by one or two &#34;strong&#34; or verbose personalities
.....with
B. Stages of voting closure that enable all participants
to see &#39;we&#39; are moving to the top choice(s) of the group
- another fan of life with alacrity
p.s. In addition to the aforementioned, brilliant, The Paradox of Choice, read Smart Choices by Howard Raiffa
