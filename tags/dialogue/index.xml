      <description>This is not a political blog, but like most bloggers I&#39;ve been indundated with various discussions about the Bush Administration, Michael Moore, Red vs. Blue, etc. So much so that on some professional email lists we&#39;ve had to ask the participants to use the text &#34;[POLITICS]&#34; in their subject lines so that we can filter out the overt political content.
One of the reasons why I tend not to participate in the political discussions is because most often they are polarizing.</description>
