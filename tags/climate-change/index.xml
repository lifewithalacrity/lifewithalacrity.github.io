      <description>Late this evening while catching up on my feeds, I saw for the first time that this year&amp;#39;s Blog Action Day&amp;#0160;is on the topic of Climate Change. This event is sponsored yearly by Change.org. I wish I had known earlier as this would have been a great exercise for my sustainable MBA students at BGI.edu, as they are all creating their blogs this week for my class &amp;quot;Using the Social Web for Social Change&amp;quot;.</description>
