      <description>Last May I did an abbreviated version of my Dunbar Number talk at MeshForum 2006. A MP3 podcast of that talk is now available at IT Conversations&amp;nbsp; or can be downloaded here (10mb).
If you&#39;d like to follow along, here is a pdf copy of my presentation sides (10mb).
Biggest addition to what I&#39;ve written about before is some discussion about different kinds of social software and what what size groups they seem to be appropriate for.</description>

      <description>In my post about the Dunbar Number I offered some evidence on the levels of satisfaction of various group sizes based on some empirical data from online games. There I was able to show that even though the Dunbar Number might predict a mean group size of 150 for humans, that in fact for non-survival oriented groups the mean was significantly less, probably between 60 to 90.
 I also offered a second hypothesis, that there is a dip in satisfaction level of groups at around the size of 15.</description>
