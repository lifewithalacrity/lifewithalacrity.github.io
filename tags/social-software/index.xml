      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82f02ac970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Little Men Circle&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82f02ac970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82f02ac970b-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Little Men Circle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As part of being a&amp;#0160;member of the sustainable MBA community at &lt;a href=&#34;http://pinchot.edu/&#34;&gt;Pinchot University&lt;/a&gt;, I have been trying to articulate what I like about the kinds of collaboration that are possible even inside a competitive industry. In our MBA program, we don&amp;#39;t just teach about competitive strategy&amp;#0160;(using classic&amp;#39;s like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/On-Competition-Michael-E-Porter/dp/0875847951&#34;&gt;Porter&amp;#39;s book&lt;/a&gt;), but we also teach about the nature of&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia link to Coopetition&#34;&gt;coopetition&lt;/a&gt;. These practices&amp;#0160;are more&amp;#0160;likely to lead to sustainable businesses (not only sustainable=green, but sustainable=enduring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a participant during several periods of technology history where coopetition has been practiced, most recently during the early days of the Twitter ecosystem. I can distinctly remember two companies&amp;#0160;offering competitive Twitter clients sharing best practices at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iosdevcamp.org&#34;&gt;iOSDevCamp&lt;/a&gt; hackathon I hosted. Unfortunately these practices ended when Twitter pulled the rug out from independent developers by controlling the API keys under the guise of &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20131017201719/https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience&#34;&gt;Delivering a Consistent Twitter Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#0160;(post now only visible on Internet Archive)&lt;/em&gt;. There are some that argue that Twitter may have ultimately &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novaspivack.com/technology/where-twitter-went-wrong-and-how-to-right-it&#34;&gt;killed its ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of short-term profits over a long-term community of innovators. We have seen this take over elsewhere as described in&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pando.com/2012/11/03/how-ecosystems-became-the-new-walled-gardens/&#34;&gt;How Ecosystems Became the New Walled Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes a great participatory ecosystem? My recent work in trying to understand Elinor Ostrom&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html&#34;&gt;design principles for the collective governance of the commons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and some other thoughts have led me to this definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Participatory Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A participatory ecosystem is a business ecosystem with relatively low barriers to economic participation, artistic and professional expression, and civic engagement by all stakeholders, including producers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has strong support for creating, sharing and increasing the production of goods and services of value to the ecosystem. A participatory ecosystem will have system processes where established stakeholders are incentivized to share knowledge, access to markets, and capital to new stakeholders in the ecosystem, and to turn consumers into producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders with leadership positions in a participatory ecosystem may change over time, but the function of an ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions, grow the market, to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A participatory system is resilient, and has system processes, such as decentralization, to prevent bad actors. Every stakeholder in a participatory ecosystem believes that their goods and services matter, and feel some degree of social connection and community with one another (at least they care what other people think about what they produce.) Not every stakeholder must produce, but all must believe that they are free to produce when ready and what they contribute will be appropriately valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not completely an original idea&amp;#0160;— it is of&amp;#0160;a mashup of Henry Jenkins’ &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_culture&#34;&gt;“participatory culture”&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;definition&amp;#0160;with&amp;#0160;James Moore’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_ecosystem&#34;&gt;“business ecosystem”&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;ideas. I&amp;#39;ve added a few&amp;#0160;things I&amp;#39;ve observed about&amp;#0160;working participatory ecosystems, and have also&amp;#0160;run this definition&amp;#0160;by a number of my colleagues in a variety of industries for small tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently I&amp;#39;ve been using it in talks about the blockchain ecosystem. I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://blockstream.com/2016/04/05/blockstream-christopher-allen-linux-foundation-w3c-ietf/&#34;&gt;recently joined&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blockstream.com&#34;&gt;Blockstream&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;where I am leading a number of&amp;#0160;strategic initiatives, including the company’s participation in cross-industry collaborations, as well as future technical efforts with international standards organizations such as W3C, IETF, and Oasis. In these efforts I have been sharing this definition more broadly, and it seems to be resonating with the community, in particular as the blockchain community cares deeply about decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted this definition to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.participatoryecosystem.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;hoping that others can fork it and submit pull requests to make it better — just like how&amp;#0160;open source world works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Revised “Ostrom’s Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons”</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html</link>

      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-250wi&#34; style=&#34;width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The traditional economic definition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the commons”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are those resources that are held in common and not privately owned. This is closely related to economic concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;public goods&lt;/a&gt;, which are goods that are both &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;non-excludable&lt;/a&gt; (in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;non-rivalrous&lt;/a&gt; (where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own personal definition for the commons is broader — any regenerative, self-organizing complex system that can be drawn upon for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artbrock.com/presentations/new-economy-new-wealth&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;deep wealth&lt;/a&gt;. These can include traditional commons, such as lumber, fish, etc., but can also include other regenerative systems such as communities, markets, intellectual property, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Elinor Ostrom&lt;/a&gt; received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her “analysis of economic governance, especially the commons”. In that, she listed 8 principles for effectively managing against the tragedy of the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;ve found her original words — as well as many adaptions I&amp;#39;ve seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there also has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to generalize her principles for broader use given my broader definition of the commons, and apply them to everything from how to manage an online community to how a business should function with competitors. I went to the original version, more contemporary research, as well as a number of modern adaptions to define a new set of design principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/03/10-design-principles-for-governing-the-commons.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;first draft&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;divided up her 8 principles into 10. I then ran this&amp;#0160;list by a number of experts in this field, and here is my second draft based on their feedback. This draft in fact breaks up her principles into 12 different ones, but I have retained her old numbering system as there are large number of works that refer to the original 8. In addition, there appears to be some differences in thoughts on number 8, so I&amp;#39;ve included two variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ostrom’s Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Avoid the Tragedy of the Commons within Self-Organizing Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1A. DEFINE AUTHORIZED USE:&lt;/strong&gt; The community of those who have the right to use the common resource is clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1B. DEFINE COMMONS BOUNDARIES:&lt;/strong&gt; The boundaries of the commons are clearly defined so as to separate the usage rules from the larger environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2A. MAKE COSTS PROPORTIONAL:&lt;/strong&gt; Costs for using and maintaining the commons are proportional to the benefits that those users receive from the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2B. PAY ALL COSTS:&lt;/strong&gt; People that use the commons keep costs inside the local system as much as possible. They do not externalize costs either to neighbors or future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3A. DECIDE INCLUSIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone who benefits from or is affected by the use of the commons makes choices about it. This includes decision-making on resource allocation and on rules and responsibilities for use of the commons. Members of the community operate with respect and mutual regard for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3B. ADAPT LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Members of the community adapt the rules and culture for the commons to local needs, resource qualities and environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4A. SHARE KNOWLEDGE:&lt;/strong&gt; All members are actively engaged in observing and sharing knowledge about the conditions of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4B. MONITOR EFFECTIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; Monitors who are members of (or supported by and accountable to) the community view and report on the use and maintenance of the commons by community members and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. HOLD ACCOUNTABLE:&lt;/strong&gt; Violators of the rules or culture of the commons face graduated sanctions, proportional to the seriousness of the transgression. These are applied by members of the community or by others who are accountable to community for applying such consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. PROMPTLY RESOLVE CONFLICTS:&lt;/strong&gt; The community offers inexpensive, fast and easy access to mediation for effective conflict resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. GOVERN LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Community self-determination is recognized and supported by higher-level authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. CONNECT TO RELATED SYSTEMS:&lt;/strong&gt; Any side effects or other repercussions by one community to another in managing their commons, should be addressed in the context of larger, nested communities that have a legitimate role in those consequences. These externalities should be resolved by the community at the most immediate or local level (aka subsidiarity) that can operate from effective human relationships, rather than by a faceless authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALT 8. COORDINATE WITH RELATED SYSTEMS&lt;/strong&gt;: For groups that are part of larger social systems, there must be appropriate coordination among relevant groups. Every sphere of activity has an optimal scale. Large scale governance requires finding the optimal scale for each sphere of activity and appropriately coordinating the activities, a concept called polycentric governance. A related concept is subsidiarity, which assigns governance tasks by default to the lowest jurisdiction, unless this is explicitly determined to be ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>A Spectrum of Consent</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/09/a-spectrum-of-consent.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 09:28:29 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/09/a-spectrum-of-consent.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Consensus-flowchart&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Consensus-flowchart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have made understanding of consent and consensus, in both their human and technological forms, a major part of my career. I have explored them through my work in cryptographic technologies, but also in human terms at the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://groupworksdeck.org/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Group Pattern Language Project&#34;&gt;Group Pattern Language Project&lt;/a&gt;, by co-authoring with Shannon Appecline forthcoming book on the design of collaborative games, and another book in progress on the patterns of cooperative play. My business management style is also more collaborative and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is so important to me that I named the company I founded in 1988 (that eventually led the effort to establish TLS 1.0 as an internet standard) was named &amp;quot;Consensus Development&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/19980709005818/http://www.consensus.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus&amp;#0160;I&amp;#39;ve been fascinated this week to watch a major online community try to define for itself what “consent” and “consensus” in their community will mean.&amp;#0160;This community in question is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency community, which is faced with a minority of the community attempting to “hard fork”. This weekend they &lt;a href=&#34;https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;meet in Montreal &lt;/a&gt;to attempt to discover another way to return to some form of unanimity and broad consent of their stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of the hardest problems in human interactions. Consent comes from the Latin, meaning “feel together”, which this community now believes they lack. But&amp;#0160;it is particularly poignant that this particular community is facing these questions. Bitcoin is technologically based on a formal protocol that uses a mathematical and cryptographic method for consensus called the “blockchain”. Every 10 minutes, thousands of nodes and hundreds of miners arrive at a consensus on all the bitcoin transactions during that time. Bitcoin, and the larger Blockchain community are the worlds experts on cryptographic forms of consensus. But the human consensus problem is still hard for them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;A Spectrum of Consent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my recent efforts into understanding this topic, and some recent dives into my &amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Systems for Collective Choice (start of series)&#34;&gt;Systems For Collective Choice&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#0160;the topic of the &lt;em&gt;A Spectrum Of Consent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;has repeatedly come up. There appear to be a range of levels of consent required for various deliberative processes and voting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had these incomplete notes on the Spectrum of Consent around for a couple of years, which I&amp;#39;ve only shared privately. However, given my discussions this week at the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Consensus 2015&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;conference and elsewhere, it was time to share. I welcome comments and suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, many groups view consensus processes as a requirement, however, many others see consensus processes as unworkable and a serious problem to be avoided. These efforts to define &lt;em&gt;A Spectrum Of Consent&lt;/em&gt; are somewhat to help me understand this dichotomy. I personally believe that certain deliberative processes and voting systems are good for some things, some for others. But I find I&amp;#39;m rare in that opinion — most people lean strongly in way one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is clearly some conflation and orthogonality in my list below of types of representation (who decides), deliberation (how you approach a decision), and choice selection method (voting system), but I think this is a good start at defining a spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uniform Consensus (or Absolute Agreement)&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where all parties are required support and agree to a decision, without anyone voting to neither agree or disagree (aka abstaining).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unanimous Consent (or Unanimity)&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where all parties support and agree to a decision, however, some parties may abstain by raising no objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus Decision Making&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative process of reaching unanimous consent (everyone agrees or abstains) with a number of procedural rules or cultural norms that limit blocking. Most forms of Consensus Decision Making all members have equal voice in the deliberation and equal vote. Most ask a closing question question such as &amp;quot;Are there any remaining unresolved concerns?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Are there any paramount objections?&amp;quot;. Some believe that in Consensus Decision Making that there is never a “vote”. (Another &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.community4me.com/consensus.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;definition of consensus&lt;/a&gt;) (PDF on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Consensus PDF&#34;&gt;Consensus Process&lt;/a&gt;) and (&lt;a href=&#34;https://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/when-not-to-use-consensus/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;When to not use Consensus&#34;&gt;when to not use consensus&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sense of Meeting&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative deliberative process practice as originally created by the Quakers. It is related to consensus which seeks “unity in the discernment of a decision” It is not necessary for every member to fully agree with a decision, but rather for members “to discern that as a body they are called in a particular direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus Minus One&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where a party may block only if they can find at least one other uninvolved party to agree to join together to block. Otherwise the decision passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus Seeking&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberation process that attempt to reach unanimous consent, but can fall back to a majority vote when required. Essentially Consensus Decision Making in deliberative process — listening to those with objections, but the ability to go to a vote stops the &amp;quot;tyranny of the minority&amp;quot; that sometimes happens with consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediated Consensus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;— Related to Consensus Seeking. An immediate decision can be made by consensus, but if that fails the blockers and proponents have to meet separately with or without a mediator, and if they still don&amp;#39;t agree then its brought back to the next meeting for a vote.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Consensus&amp;#0160;(still seeking right name of this one)&lt;/strong&gt; — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. Consensus is required within each group but not of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consequential Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)&lt;/strong&gt; — Only those affected by the outcome of the decision can participate and vote in the decision, which requires consensus of all those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representative Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)&lt;/strong&gt; — Each party who participates in the deliberation votes represents the interests of others by some rules. Consensus is required only among the representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciative Inquiry Based Deliberation (another one needing naming)&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative process that focuses on moving forward on moving forward on things that there is agreement on that are &amp;quot;the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking or Vetoing Representation&lt;/strong&gt;— Voting systems where one or more members may have the right to block the deliberative process before a vote, or veto after a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute Super Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be larger than a simple majority based on the entire membership rather than only on those present and voting, typically 2/3rds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Majority or Qualified Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be greater than a simple majority of those present and voting, typically 2/3rds of those voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be 50% + 1 vote, based on the entire membership rather than on those present and voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be 50% + 1 vote of those present and voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules of Order or&amp;#0160;Parliamentary&amp;#0160;Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;— A deliberative process such as&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Robert&amp;#39;s Rules of Order&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;other rules&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;used by legislative bodies such as a senate or parliaments,&amp;#0160;but &amp;#0160;often used by corporations for decision making such as a board of directors meeting.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;At their heart is the rule of the majority with respect for the minority. Its object is to allow deliberation&amp;#0160;upon questions of interest to the group and to arrive at the sense or the will of the organization as a whole upon these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plurality or Relative Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where when there are multiple options, the largest number of votes wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Fork&lt;/strong&gt; — Unique to open source communities, consensus can be reached by having the stakeholders lacking consensus to split off to form their own consensus, and since the assets are largely intellectual the can compete equally for the attention of the community and markets they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citizen Assembly (sometimes called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;sortition&#34;&gt;sortition&lt;/a&gt;, public sector representation, jury or allotment)&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative process where a representative random sample of eligible voters is selected to make binding decisions for the group. The voting system used may be consensus or some form of majority. Ancient Athenian democracy actually form of this of this in the Boule and Jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Authority&lt;/strong&gt; — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. How each group makes decisions is decided by that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Authority&lt;/strong&gt; — Rules for how a party is elected to represent a group, who then has authority to make decisions for that group, typically for a limited period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictatorship&lt;/strong&gt; — Executive authority exercised to ensure a monopoly of authority by its elected representative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This article has been cross-posted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@christophera/the-four-kinds-of-privacy-bf4b0bf222ac&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Medium&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd15c970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Ssh by Katie Tegtmeyer CC-BY (crop2)&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd15c970b-500wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Ssh by Katie Tegtmeyer CC-BY&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Privacy is hitting the headlines more than ever. As computer users are asked to change their passwords again and again in the wake of exploits like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://heartbleed.com/&#34;&gt;Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Shellshock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, they&amp;#39;re becoming aware of the vulnerability of their online data — a susceptibility that was recently verified by scores of celebrities who had their most intimate photographs stolen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; of us could have our privacy violated at any time… but what does that mean exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s a tricky question, and I say that with decades of experience in the privacy and security fields. In the early &amp;#39;90s I helped with anti-Clipper Chip activism and supported efforts to allow free export of RSAREF cryptography tools such as PGP. I&amp;#39;m also the co-author of the internet SSL standard, now the most broadly deployed security standard in the world (the &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;https&amp;quot;). I&amp;#39;ve been involved with several security companies — as an entrepreneur, a former CTO of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.certicom.com/&#34;&gt;Certicom&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently as the VP of Developer Relations at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackphone.ch/&#34;&gt;Blackphone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all that time, I&amp;#39;ve been very careful about my use of the word &amp;quot;privacy&amp;quot;. For example, I founded a company that designed and sold the first commercial SSL toolkits. The technology clearly included privacy features, but our marketing said that SSL offered &amp;quot;message integrity&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;confidentiality&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;authentication&amp;quot;. We did not use the word &amp;quot;privacy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This purposeful omission resulted from my feeling that the concept was too overloaded; if I promised privacy I might not be promising the same thing to everyone because people view the term in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What privacy means varies between Europe and the US, between libertarians and public figures, between the developed world and developing countries, between women and men. I think it&amp;#39;s possible to differentiate no less than four different kinds of privacy, each of which is important to different people — and I&amp;#39;m going to be defining them over the course of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Prelude: Defining Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d106582b970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cayucos Parade (Cropped, original by Mike Baird licensed CC-BY)&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d106582b970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d106582b970c-500wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Cayucos Parade (Cropped, original by Mike Baird licensed CC-BY)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;However, before you can define privacy, you first have to define its opposite number: what&amp;#39;s public. &lt;a href=&#34;http://meriam-webster.com/&#34;&gt;Meriam-Webster.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s first definition of &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; includes two different descriptions that are somewhat contradictory. The first is &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;exposed to general view: open&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; and the second is &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;well-known; prominent&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These definitions are at odds with each other because it&amp;#39;s easy for something to be exposed to view &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; it being prominent. In fact, that defines a lot of our everyday life. If you have a conversation with a friend in a restaurant or if you do something in your living room with the curtains open or if you write a message for friends on Facebook, you presume that what you&amp;#39;re doing will not be well-known, but it certainly &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be open to general view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is it public or is it private?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this is a very old question. When talking about recent celebrity photo thefts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psmag.com/navigation/politics-and-law/celebrity-photo-hacking-scandal-shows-old-privacy-laws-need-serious-update-90087/&#34;&gt;Kyle Chayka&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the early 20th-century case of Gabrielle Darley Melvin, an ex-prostitute who had been acquitted of murderer. After settling quietly into marriage, Melvin found herself the subject of an unauthorized movie that ripped apart the fabric of her new life. Melvin sued the makers of the film but lost. She was told in the 1931 decision &lt;a href=&#34;https://casetext.com/case/melvin-v-reid&#34;&gt;Melvin v. Reid&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;When the incidents of a life are so public as to be spread upon a public record they come within the knowledge and into the possession of the public and cease to be private.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; So the Supreme Court of Los Angeles had one answer for what was public and what was private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melvin&amp;#39;s case was one where public events had clearly entered the public consciousness. However today, more and more of what people once thought of as private is also escaping into the public sphere — and we&amp;#39;re often surprised by it. That&amp;#39;s because we think that private means secret, and it doesn&amp;#39;t; it just means something that isn&amp;#39;t public. Yet. &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/message/what-is-public-f33b16d780f9&#34;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; recently discussed this on &lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt; and he highlighted a few reasons that privacy is rapidly sliding down this slippery slope of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, companies have financial incentives for making things &amp;quot;well-known&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;prominent&amp;quot;. The 24-hour news cycle is forcing media to report &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, so they&amp;#39;re mobbing celebrities and publishing conversations from Facebook or Twitter that people consider private. Meanwhile, an increasing number of tech companies are mining deep ores of data and selling them to the highest bidder; the more information that they can find, the more they can sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, technology is making it ridiculously easy to take those situations that are considered &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; despite being &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;exposed to general view&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; and making them public. It&amp;#39;s easier than ever to record a conversation, or steal data, or photograph or film through a window, or overhear a discussion. Some of these methods are legal, some aren&amp;#39;t, but they&amp;#39;re all happening — and they seem to be becoming more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is big enough that governments are passing laws on the topic. In May 2014, the European Court of Justice decreed that people had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Right to Be Forgotten&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;: they should be able to remove information about themselves from the public sphere if it&amp;#39;s no longer relevant, making it private once more. Whether this was a good decision remains to be seen, as it&amp;#39;s already resulted in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/02/wikipedia-page-google-link-hidden-right-to-be-forgotten&#34;&gt;removal of information&lt;/a&gt; that clearly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; relevant to the public sphere. In addition, it&amp;#39;s very much at odds with the laws and rights of the United States, especially the free speech clause of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment1.html&#34;&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. As Jeffrey Toobin said in a recent &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/29/solace-oblivion&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;In Europe, the right to privacy trumps freedom of speech; the reverse is true in the United States.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this means that the line between public and private remains as fuzzy as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a deep need for the public world: both to be a part of it and to share ourselves with it. However, we also have a deep need for privacy: to keep our information, our households, our activities, and our intimate connections free from general view. In the modern world, drawing the line between these two poles is something that every single person has to consider and manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s important that each individual define their own privacy needs — so that they can fight for the kinds of privacy that are important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;The First Kind: Defensive Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd194970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hacker (Cropped, original by Christophe Verdier licensed CC-BY-NC) &#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd194970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd194970b-500wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Hacker (Cropped, original by Christophe Verdier licensed CC-BY-NC) &#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first type of privacy is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;defensive privacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which protects against transient financial loss resulting from information collection or theft. This is the territory of phishers, conmen, blackmailers, identity thieves, and organized crime. It could also be the purview of governments that seize assets from people or businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important characteristic of defensive privacy is that any loss is ultimately transitory. A phisher might temporarily access a victim&amp;#39;s bank accounts, or an identity thief might cause problems by taking out new credit in the victim&amp;#39;s name, or a government might confiscate a victim&amp;#39;s assets. However, once a victim&amp;#39;s finances have been lost, and they&amp;#39;ve spent some time clearing the problem up, they can then get back on their feet. The losses also might be recoverable — or if not, at least insurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of privacy is nonetheless important because assaults against it are very common and the losses can still be very damaging. The latest Bureau of Justice &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/vit12pr.cfm&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; says that 16.6 million Americans were affected in 2012 by identity theft alone, resulting in $24.7 billion dollars being stolen, or about $1,500 per victim. Though most victims were able to clear up the problems in less than a day, 10% had to spend more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though defensive privacy is usually violated by illegal acts, US courts haven&amp;#39;t always recognized the need for privacy of financial records. For example, in the 1976 case &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15052729295643479698&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=6&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholarr&#34;&gt;United States vs. Miller&lt;/a&gt; — which was about defrauding the government of whiskey tax — the Supreme Court declared that an individual&amp;#39;s financial records at a bank were not &amp;quot;private papers&amp;quot; but instead the &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;business records of the banks&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be that the biggest danger to defensive privacy was someone digging through a victim&amp;#39;s trash for old bank and credit card statements. However, today the interconnectiveness of the world is making it easier than ever to trick someone out of their financial information. Phishing emails are growing increasingly sophisticated, while social scammers are taking over Facebook and email accounts to pretend to be friends in distress in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hoax-slayer.com/stranded-scam.shtml&#34;&gt;foreign country&lt;/a&gt;. The newest fad seems to be a resurrection of an old con: cold calling victims and pretending to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snopes.com/fraud/telephone/microsoft.asp&#34;&gt;Microsoft support&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of taking over a victim&amp;#39;s computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, defensive privacy is more important than ever — which is unfortunately a trend that crosses all of the kinds of privacy in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;The Second Kind: Human Rights Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d849970d-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Human Rights Privacy (Anne Frank Photo 1942)&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d849970d img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d849970d-500wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Human Rights Privacy (Anne Frank Photo 1942)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The second type of privacy is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which protects against existential threats resulting from information collection or theft. This is the territory of stalkers and other felonious criminals as well as authoritarian governments and other persons intent on doing damage to someone for personal for his or her beliefs or political views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important characteristic of human rights privacy is that violations usually result in more long-lasting losses than was the case with defensive privacy. Most obviously, authoritarian governments and hardline theocracies might imprison or kill victims while criminals might murder them. However, political groups could also ostracize or blacklist a victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, human rights privacy is one of the most &lt;em&gt;crucial&lt;/em&gt; sorts of privacy. This comes from the continent&amp;#39;s history: the Netherlands in the 1930s had a very comprehensive administrative census and registration of their own population that collected a lot of personal information. The Nazis captured this data within the first three days of occupation. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Dark Side of Numbers&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; by William Seltzer and Margo Anderson (published in &lt;em&gt;Social Research&lt;/em&gt; Vol. 68 No. 2 — Summer 2001), reports the inevitable result: Dutch Jews had the highest death rate (73 percent) of Jews residing in any occupied Western European country — far higher than the death rate among the Jewish population of Belgium (40 percent) or France (25 percent). Even the death rate in Germany was lower than in the Netherlands because the Jews there had avoided registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the issue of human rights privacy didn&amp;#39;t end there. As Oxford professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberge explained in Jeffrey Toobin&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/29/solace-oblivion&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, Europe continued to experience serious human rights attacks during the Cold War. Mayer-Schönberge states: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;With the Stasi, in East Germany, the task of capturing information and using it to further the power of the state is reintroduced and perfected by the society. So we had two radical ideologies, Fascism and Communism, and both end up with absolutely shockingly tight surveillance states.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, citizens are shielded from governmental abuses of human rights privacy by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment&#34;&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. As a result, I personally felt good about human rights privacy in the US — until the presidency of George W. Bush and his first attorney general, John Ashcroft. Under their watch, the Patriot Act dramatically increased the ability of the US government to surveil its citizens, with some of the worst mandates of that law making it illegal for the subject of the surveillance to even talk about being target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, individuals aren&amp;#39;t the only ones facing the governmental breach of human rights privacy in the US. Ever since the 1972 Supreme Court case, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11598860258825518787&#34;&gt;Branzburg v. Hayes&lt;/a&gt;, the press has also been fighting against governmental demands to reveal confidential sources and direct governmental assaults on sites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/surveillance-and-pressure-wikileaks-readers&#34;&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt;. Some US states have created shield laws to protect the press&amp;#39; privacy, but they&amp;#39;re often not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today journalist James Risen faces jail for protecting a source. In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/13-1009.resp_.pdf&#34;&gt;court filing&lt;/a&gt;, Risen said &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;…this court should reconsider Branzburg because in recent years, subpoenas to journalists seeking the identity of confidential sources have &amp;#39;become commonplace.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The Obama administration responded by stating, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;…reporters have no privilege to refuse to provide direct evidence of criminal wrongdoing by confidential sources.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The US Supreme Court refused Risen&amp;#39;s appeal in June 2014, leaving him on the hook for the information or jail time. Meanwhile, other journalists &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/28/us-surveillance-harming-journalism-law-democracy&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that surveillance is increasingly intimidating sources, making it hard to report on government activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, these American governmental excesses are causing some corporations to consider how they can bolster the cause of human rights privacy: with the release of iOS8, Apple &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would no longer have access to users&amp;#39; mobile passcodes, making it nearly impossible for them to turn information over to the government. Google quickly followed on by making Android encryption easier for the public to access. Predictably, the US government isn&amp;#39;t &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/30/holder-urges-tech-companies-to-leave-device-backdoors-open-for-police/&#34;&gt;happy&lt;/a&gt;, and security experts are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/10/iphone_encrypti_1.html&#34;&gt;nonplussed&lt;/a&gt; by their complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though governments are the biggest actors on the stage of human rights breaches, individuals can also attack this sort of privacy — with cyberbullies being among the prime culprits. Though a bully&amp;#39;s harassment &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; only involve words, the attackers frequently release personal information about the person they&amp;#39;re harassing, which can cause the bullying to snowball. For example Jessica Logan, Hope Sitwell, and Amanda Todd were bullied after their nude pictures were broadcast, while Tyler Clementi was bullied after a hall-mate streamed video of Clementi kissing another young man. Unfortunately, cyberbullying often results in &lt;a href=&#34;http://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/&#34;&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;, showing the existential dangers of these privacy breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if threats aren&amp;#39;t taken seriously, cyberbullying doubles back to the issue of defensive privacy, as revealed by Amanda Hess in her article &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/women-arent-welcome-internet-72170/&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Why Women Aren&amp;#39;t Welcome on the Internet&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; where she wrote: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Threats of rape, death, and stalking can overpower our emotional bandwidth, take up our time, and cost us money through legal fees, online protection services, and missed wages.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hess is just one of a long list of women who have been targeted by cyberbullies online. Programmer Kathy Sierra was largely driven out of the tech industry back in 2007 for being too influential; she recently wrote about how this is part of a long-standing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win&#34;&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; of purposeful violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, a study by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Pew Research&lt;/a&gt; revealed that about 25% of women aged 18–24 have been stalked or sexually harassed online — numbers far in excess of their male peers. It was a timely study because Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, and Brianna Wu all came under cyberbullying assault around the same time due to their positions as female leaders in the gaming field. When actress and gamer Felicia Day dared to speak out against this problem, her home address and personal email were revealed in a &amp;quot;doxing&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;within an hour,&lt;/em&gt; showing how fragile privacy is on the modern internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not surprising that some of my own female associates are unwilling to post pictures or other personal information online for fear of just this sort of attack. And we&amp;#39;re relatively lucky in the western world: in a hardline theocracy like Afghanistan, a woman&amp;#39;s need for privacy can be even stronger, with many women not willing to use their real names online — or a female name at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals taking part in the democratic process can also come under a personal onslaught of this sort. This has gained prominence in California in recent years when numerous people have been called to task over their contributions to Prop 8, an anti-gay-marriage ballot measure that is now widely considered homophobic and bigoted. Brendan Eich, Mozilla&amp;#39;s CEO, was forced out of his job as a result of such a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2014/04/brendan_eich_quits_mozilla_let_s_purge_all_the_antigay_donors_to_prop_8.html&#34;&gt;contribution&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that his donation was six years previous in a very different political climate shows how long-lasting this sort of damage can be. On the flip-side, the NRA has also been known to go after public figures with anti-gun views. Political repercussions of this sort are a more complex issue than simple cyberbullying, but they demonstrate another situation where individuals might wish they could assert their human rights privacy to shield themselves from damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;The Third Kind: Personal Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065861970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Personal Privacy (Cropped from original %22Don&amp;#39;t Tread on Me%22 by DonkeyHotey on Flickr CC-BY-SA)&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065861970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065861970c-500wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Personal Privacy (Cropped from original %22Don&amp;#39;t Tread on Me%22 by DonkeyHotey on Flickr CC-BY-SA)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The third type of privacy is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;personal privacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which protects persons against observation and intrusion; it&amp;#39;s what Judge Thomas Cooley called &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;the right to be let alone&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, as cited by future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1321160&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;The Right to Privacy&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which he wrote for the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Law Review&lt;/em&gt; of December 15, 1890. Brandeis&amp;#39; championing of this sort of privacy would result in a new, uniquely American right that has at times been attributed to the First Amendment (giving freedom of speech within one&amp;#39;s house), the Fourth Amendment (protecting one&amp;#39;s house from search &amp;amp; seizure by the government), and the Fifth Amendment (protecting one&amp;#39;s private house from public use). This right can also be found in state Constitutions, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constitution of California&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which promises &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;safety, happiness, and privacy&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When personal privacy is breached we can lose &lt;em&gt;our right to be ourselves&lt;/em&gt;. Without Brandeis&amp;#39; protection, we could easily come under Panoptic observation where we could be forced to act unlike ourselves even in our personal lives. Unfortunately, this isn&amp;#39;t just a theory: a recent PEN America survey shows that 1 in 6 authors already &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pen.org/chilling-effects&#34;&gt;self-censor&lt;/a&gt; due to NSA surveillance. Worse, it could be damaging: another report shows that unselfconscious time is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html?smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;amp;smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;amp;_r=1&#34;&gt;restorative&lt;/a&gt; and that low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety can result from its lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Brandeis almost single-handedly created personal privacy, it didn&amp;#39;t come easily. The Supreme Court refused to protect it in a 1928 wire-tapping case called &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5577544660194763070%29&#34;&gt;Olmstead v. United States&lt;/a&gt;; in response, Brandeis wrote a famous dissenting opinion that brought his ideas about privacy into the official record of the Court. Despite this initial loss, personal privacy gained advocates in the Supreme Court over the years, who often referred to Brandeis&amp;#39; 1890 article. By the 1960s, Brandeis&amp;#39; ideas were in the mainstream and in the 1967 Supreme Court case &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594&#34;&gt;Katz v. United States&lt;/a&gt;, Olmstead was finally overturned. Though the Court&amp;#39;s opinion said that personal privacy was &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;left largely to the law of the individual States&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, it had clearly become a proper expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideas that Brandeis championed about personal privacy are shockingly modern. They focused on the Victorian equivalent of the paparazzi, as Brandeis made clear when he said: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; He also carefully threaded the interface between public and private, saying, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, personal privacy is the special concern of the more Libertarian-oriented founders of the Internet, such as Bit Torrent founder Bram Cohen, who demanded the &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20010710021553/http://bitconjurer.org/a_technological_activists_agenda.html&#34;&gt;basic human rights&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;to be free of intruders&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;to privacy&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Personal privacy is more of an issue than ever for celebrities and other public figures, but attacks upon it also touch the personal life of average citizens. It&amp;#39;s the focus of the &amp;quot;do not call&amp;quot; registry and other telemarketing laws and of ordinances outlawing soliciting and trespass. It&amp;#39;s the right at the heart of doing what we please in our own homes — whether it be eating dinner in peace, discussing controversial politics &amp;amp; religion with our close friends, or playing sexual games with our partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though personal privacy has grown in power in America since the 1960s, it&amp;#39;s still under constant attack from the media, telemarketing interests, and the government. Meanwhile, it&amp;#39;s not an absolute across the globe: some cultures, such as those in China and parts of Europe, actively preach against it — advocating that community and sharing trump personal privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fourth Kind: Contextual Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d864970d-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Contextual Privacy (Post Secret #2 by Meg Wilis, licensed CC-BY) &#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d864970d img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d864970d-500wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Contextual Privacy (Post Secret #2 by Meg Wilis, licensed CC-BY) &#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The fourth type of privacy is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;contextual privacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which protects persons against unwanted intimacy. This is what danah boyd calls &lt;a href=&#34;http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/04/16/the_ickiness_factor.php%29&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Ickiness Factor&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Ickiness is the guttural reaction that makes you cringe, scrunch your nose or gasp &amp;#39;ick&amp;#39; simply because there&amp;#39;s something slightly off, something disconcerting, something not socially right about an interaction…. The ickiness factor is tightly coupled with issues [of] feeling vulnerable or getting the sense that someone else is vulnerable because of a given situation.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to defend contextual privacy can result in the loss of relationships with others. No one presents the same persona in the office as they do when spending time with their kids or even when meeting with other parents. They speak different languages to each of these different &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot;, and their connection to each tribe could be at risk if they mispoke by putting on the wrong persona or speaking the wrong language at the wrong time. Worse, the harm from this sort of privacy breach may also be increasing in the age of data mining, as bad actors can increasingly put together information from different contexts and twist them into a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; picture that simultaneously might be damning and completely false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it&amp;#39;s easy to understand what can be lost with a breach of contextual privacy, the concept can still be confusing because contextual privacy overlaps with other sorts of privacy; it could involve the theft of information or an unwelcome intrusion, but the result is different. Where theft of information might make you feel disadvantaged (if a conman stole your financial information) or endangered (if the government discovered you were whistle blowing), and where an intrusion might make you feel annoyed (if a telemarketer called during dinner), a violation of contextual privacy instead makes you feel emotionally uncomfortable and exposed — or as boyd said, &amp;quot;vulnerable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that this feeling of vulnerability often comes from an inappropriate level of intimacy. Some of the more professional social networks seem particularly prone to it: I felt uncomfortable when I realized that my professional colleagues on one of the earliest social networks could see that I was in a committed relationship, and in turn I could see that some of them were in open marriages. Not that I had any problem with the information, but did I &amp;quot;need to know&amp;quot; in the context of business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably won&amp;#39;t find any case law about contextual privacy, because it&amp;#39;s a fairly new concept and because there&amp;#39;s less &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; harm. However social networks from Facebook and LinkedIn to Twitter and LiveJournal are all facing contextual privacy problems as they each try to become the home for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sorts of social interaction. This causes people — in particular women and members of the LGBT communities — to try and keep multiple profiles, only to find &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;real name&amp;quot; policies&lt;/a&gt; working against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some social networks make things worse by creating artificial social pressures to reveal information, as occurs when someone tags you in a Facebook picture or in status update. To date, Google+ is one of the few networks to attempt a solution by creating &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/circles/&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;circles&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to precisely specify who in your social network should get each piece of information that you share. However, it&amp;#39;s unclear how many people use this feature. A related feature on Facebook called &amp;quot;Lists&amp;quot; is rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a lack of personal privacy causes you to &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;not be yourself&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, a loss of contextual privacy allows other to &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;not see you as yourself&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. You risk being perceived as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;other&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; when your actions are seen out of context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four of these kinds of privacy can intersect. For example, some social networks allow you to reveal your sexual orientation, which could be used secretly by an employer to discriminate against you (&lt;em&gt;defensive privacy&lt;/em&gt;) or by a future Ashcroftian government to violate your civil rights (&lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;). It might lead you to being bothered at home because of people who either agree with or disagree with your orientation (&lt;em&gt;personal privacy) _and often is an inappropriate revelation for casual professional acquaintances (&lt;/em&gt;contextual privacy_).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of current events offer more examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Case: Celebrity Hacking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d870970d-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2013 X-Men (by Gage Skidmore. licensed CC-BY)&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d870970d img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d870970d-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2013 X-Men (by Gage Skidmore. licensed CC-BY)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The recent unauthorized release of nude pictures of Jennifer Lawrence and others demonstrates the complex permutations of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, it highlighted the problematic divide between public and private. There&amp;#39;s no doubt that the pictures were intended to be private, and unlike some of the more troublesome uses of recording devices, these private situations &lt;em&gt;weren&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; made public through the uncomfortable use of surveillance technology. Instead, the photos were publicized following theft. Unfortunately, now that they&amp;#39;re in the public eye, they&amp;#39;re unlikely to go away, ever. In other words, the genie&amp;#39;s out of the bottle. All that the celebrities can do is make the photos less accessible by asserting their copyright (if they can to get search engines to de-link the information).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Europe&amp;#39;s Right to Be Forgotten will someday help to remove this type of occurrence from the internet. Or perhaps something like California&amp;#39;s recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/sen/sb_0251-0300/sb_255_bill_20130507_amended_sen_v98.html&#34;&gt;SB 255&lt;/a&gt; might make it illegal to distribute nude photos without the model&amp;#39;s permission. Alternatively, it could be social mores that win out, if we follow &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;the ethics of looking away&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, as advocated by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/leaked-photos-nude-celebrities-abuse/379434/&#34;&gt;Jessica Valenti&lt;/a&gt;); Jennifer Lawrence herself agreed there are ethical problems, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/10/jennifer-lawrence-cover&#34;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Anybody who looked at those pictures, you&amp;#39;re perpetuating a sexual offense.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; However for now, the pictures are out there &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; being viewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering the four kinds of privacy, these celebrities primarily suffered from an unwanted intimacy with the entire world (&lt;em&gt;contextual privacy&lt;/em&gt;). Lawrence explained the problem succinctly, saying: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t tell you that you could look at my naked body.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrities and other high-profile victims might also face financial repercussions (&lt;em&gt;defensive privacy&lt;/em&gt;). Ariana Grande was one of the younger victims of the theft and one of the few to risk the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect&#34;&gt;Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt; by saying her photos weren&amp;#39;t authentic. She should never have had to make such a statement one way or the other, but one understands why she would: as a teen pop star recently featured on a pair of Nickelodeon shows, she risks the greatest fiscal damage of any of the victims. But even Lawrence worried, stating: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know how this would affect my career.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Sullivan offered some of the most adroit commentary on the theft when he &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mtv.com/news/1918278/jennifer-lawrence-photos-not-a-scandal/&#34;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t call it a scandal&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. By calling this a scandal and smugly shaking our heads, we&amp;#39;re blaming the victims, not the criminals. Worse, we&amp;#39;re embarking on a slippery slope where we suggest that people take away their own freedoms through self-censorship. By calling it a scandal, we are saying that even in their own homes, using their own cameras, these people shouldn&amp;#39;t be themselves (&lt;em&gt;personal privacy&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_8&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Case: #GamerGate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065886970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Zoe Quinn (by Zoe Quinn, licensed CC-BY-SA)&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065886970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065886970c-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Zoe Quinn (by Zoe Quinn, licensed CC-BY-SA)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The widespread and ongoing harassment of game designer Zoe Quinn is a somewhat frightening example for its intense focus on the repeated privacy violations of a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with a blog post by Quinn&amp;#39;s ex-boyfriend that accused her of infidelity. This once more highlights the troubled modern divide between public and private. Though some countries &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; protect the release of information of this sort using defamation laws, it seems unlikely that the US&amp;#39;s slander or libel laws would do so. Despite the likely legality of that initial post, the public still learned inappropriate information about Quinn (&lt;em&gt;contextual privacy&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, worse privacy violations followed: the online community 4chan &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing&#34;&gt;doxed&lt;/a&gt; Quinn by collecting considerable semi-public information about her (more &lt;em&gt;contextual privacy)&lt;/em&gt;, which allowed online harassment to evolve into threatening phone calls (&lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;). The information revealed during the harassment included the fact that Quinn had dated a game industry journalist, which could impact Quinn&amp;#39;s ability to sell games in the future or even to get reviewed (&lt;em&gt;defensive privacy&lt;/em&gt;). Obviously, the continual harassment has also violated Quinn&amp;#39;s personal space and her right to be let alone (&lt;em&gt;personal privacy&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the initial assaults on Quinn, the #GamerGate mob has moved on to harass other female game designers, including Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna Wu, as well as gamer and actress Felicia Day — all using the same privacy-busting methodology of cyberbullying and doxing. The movement may have reached its height when terrorist threats were made against a talk planned by Sarkeesian, forcing her to cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, it was difficult for groups of individuals to work together to violate the privacy rights of an individual; there also wasn&amp;#39;t a medium that could be used to publish personal details about someone unless there was a clear public interest. The cyberbullying stemming from #GamerGate shows that&amp;#39;s all changed in the modern age. Which is why privacy is such a major concern for so many people on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Third Case: The NSA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

In the United States, it&amp;#39;s the NSA who&amp;#39;s been at the heart of the privacy controversies (with a little help from their friends in the FBI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the new privacy-busting powers of these organizations originated with the USA &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf&#34;&gt;Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt;, but follow-up laws like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-121/pdf/STATUTE-121-Pg552.pdf&#34;&gt;Protect America Act&lt;/a&gt; of 2007 and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;FISA Amendment Act&lt;/a&gt; of 2008 are equally invasive. We only know how these laws are actually being utilized thanks to the whistle-blowing of Edward Snowden and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most obviously, these types of laws have allowed the collection of private data in large quantities (&lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;). We now know that the NSA uses a previously secret program called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/12/heres-everything-we-know-about-prism-to-date/&#34;&gt;PRISM&lt;/a&gt; to coordinate data collection using court orders and that they also appear to have broken into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html&#34;&gt;communication links&lt;/a&gt; to tap major data centers. There are claims that they also &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-11/nsa-said-to-have-used-heartbleed-bug-exposing-consumers.html&#34;&gt;exploited the Heartbleed bug&lt;/a&gt; for years in order to collect data, though they deny this. The human rights repercussions of this multi-pronged, largely unfettered data collection are mind-boggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most worrisome issues with this sort of large-scale data collection is that it can result in mistakes when something is taken out of context (&lt;em&gt;contextual privacy&lt;/em&gt;). Someone might feel like they have nothing to fear from the government — until they&amp;#39;re arrested for something they said while roleplaying in an MMORPG. Unfortunately, this isn&amp;#39;t an unfounded concern: Snowden&amp;#39;s whistleblowing revealed that the NSA spies on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-10/nsa-infiltrating-online-video-games-leaked-documents-show/5147394&#34;&gt;video game chats&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this type of contextual disconnect has already caused problems in other legal contexts, such as when firefighter Lt. Philip Lyons was falsely charged with arson based on the purchase of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002055245_arson06m.html&#34;&gt;fire-starter&lt;/a&gt; that was revealed through loyalty card records. Reports similarly indicate that the FBI was tracking the sale of &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20071221122513/http://cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&amp;amp;docID=hsnews-000002620892&#34;&gt;Middle Eastern foods&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco as a terrorist-finding tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union has much more mature protections against data collection of this sort, thanks to the Data Protection Directive of 1995, which is now in the process of being &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;reformed&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, the US has only responded in a piecemeal way that largely depends on private corporations&amp;#39; privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the US, we find that many of these data collection and spying laws have been wrapped up with authoritarian regulations that go after individuals — such as one of Edward Snowden&amp;#39;s email providers, LavaBit founder Ladar Levison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levison wrote an article about his interactions with the FBI that reads like an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email&#34;&gt;Orwellian parody&lt;/a&gt;. He described how the FBI served him papers seven times and forced him to appear in a court 1,000 miles from home without an attorney as part of their heavy-handed attempt to acquire Snowden&amp;#39;s encryption keys. His company, LavaBit, was eventually shut down as a result. Because Levison tried to protect the privacy of one of his customers, he was threatened with jail and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;compelled to silence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;personal privacy&lt;/em&gt;). Even Yahoo&amp;#39;s CEO Marissa Meyer is personally worried about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/11/yahoo-ceo-mayer-jail-nsa-surveillance&#34;&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt;. She says tech companies aren&amp;#39;t talking more about the government&amp;#39;s surveillance because they&amp;#39;re afraid: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Releasing classified information is treason and you are incarcerated.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of compelled silence arises from the National Security Letters authorized by the USA Patriot Act. It&amp;#39;s particularly troublesome because it threatens democracy just as much as a lack of voting anonymity would. Because the Letters can&amp;#39;t be discussed, there&amp;#39;s no way to assess whether the government is doing a good job or not — and thus no way to punish a government at the voting booth if they&amp;#39;re stepping over the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fourth Case: Americans in Afghanistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1ca970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Afgan Social Media Summit (cropped, original by Luisa Whalmsey, licensed CC-BY)&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1ca970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1ca970b-500wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Afgan Social Media Summit (cropped, original by Luisa Whalmsey, licensed CC-BY)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My final case study is a personal one. I&amp;#39;ve regularly taught &amp;quot;Digital Influence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Using the Social Web for Social Change&amp;quot; classes in the Bainbridge Graduate Institute&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://bgi.pinchot.edu/&#34;&gt;MBA in Sustainable Systems&lt;/a&gt; program at Pinchot University. One of my students there was Luisa Walmsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at BGI, Luisa met a woman who had co-founded Afghanistan&amp;#39;s largest telecommunications company. Luisa later went to work at the company, then started her own consultancy doing operations and business development for Afghan media and technology companies — in the process helping women in Afghanistan to become better entrepreneurs. She&amp;#39;s also been involved with Afghanistan&amp;#39;s first-ever &lt;a href=&#34;http://socialmediasummit.af/&#34;&gt;social media summit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, being a female professional in Afghanistan can still be quite dangerous. Women have only been able to widely reenter the work force in the last decade, since the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban, and today they are sometimes still attacked or threatened for doing so. This makes Luisa&amp;#39;s need for privacy important (&lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luisa&amp;#39;s situation also demonstrates the sorts of divides you can find in a human rights privacy case. While in Afghanistan, Luisa follows basic security procedures to protect her privacy from both terrorists and the government — such as varying the times of day that she travels to the office. She&amp;#39;s still willing to use social media but is careful, for example occasionally lying about her location or not talking about her travel plans or waiting days to post pictures that might reveal information as to her whereabouts. However Luisa has to be even more careful with the human rights concerns of the women she&amp;#39;s working with, who could be assaulted or killed for their decision to make a career for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even outside of her work proper, Luisa has run into other sorts of privacy issues in Afghanistan. She was once asked by an Afghan government agency to remove a Facebook post that reprinted an international organization&amp;#39;s security alert concerning elections security, which she&amp;#39;d reposted in order to warn her friends. She&amp;#39;s also received phone harassment (&lt;em&gt;personal privacy&lt;/em&gt;) that would be unthinkable in the US: in Afghanistan men cold call phone numbers and when they hear a woman&amp;#39;s voice on the other side, they continuously call back. Luisa was often able to stop the calls, but some of her female friends would receive over 200 harassing phone calls of this sort a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Luisa&amp;#39;s work also runs straight back into the privacy problems originating with the NSA. In 2013, the NSA admitted that they tracked phone calls of people &lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/you-may-already-be-a-winner-in-nsas-three-degrees-surveillance-sweepstakes/&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;two to three hops&amp;quot; away&lt;/a&gt; from suspected terrorists. However in Afghanistan, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; working in human rights or in the media is going to have some &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; contact with the Taliban. Luisa surely has (one hop), so as soon as she calls or emails me (two hops), I&amp;#39;m suddenly in the NSA jackpot (more &lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;). And how does the NSA get that information? In 2014 we learned that they&amp;#39;re recording nearly all domestic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; international &lt;a href=&#34;https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-statement-on-the-mass.html&#34;&gt;phone calls in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; (massive &lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we know that the FBI once though it was relevant to track falafel sales, and because I gained an appreciation for Middle Eastern music 15 years ago, I could easily become a serious terror suspect myself (yet more &lt;em&gt;human rights privacy&lt;/em&gt;). Worse, if you&amp;#39;re reading this article (&lt;em&gt;three hops&lt;/em&gt;), you now might be in the NSA&amp;#39;s sights too. Hope you don&amp;#39;t like &lt;em&gt;hummus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;baba ghannouj&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is important — perhaps more so than ever due to the assaults by con artists, governments, the press, and social media in the 21st century. However, in order to protect your own privacy, you must define your terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, that requires: understanding the difference between private and public; considering how to prevent information from escaping from the one to the other; and thinking about how that might interact with free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it requires understanding the different kinds of privacy, and figuring out which one is most topical to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Is it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;defensive privacy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_ W_here you worry about conmen, phishers, or other thieves stealing from you? Do you fear the finances loss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Is it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;human rights privacy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_ W_here you&amp;#39;re threatened by the actions of a government or other entity? Do you fear the loss of your life or your freedom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Is it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;personal privacy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Where you just want to be be left alone? Do you fear the loss of the freedom to be yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Is it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;contextual privacy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Where you want to partition different portions of your life? Do you fear the loss of your relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will have some concerns about multiple sorts of privacy, but there will probably be one or two that strike a chord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s important to you?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/03/10-design-principles-for-governing-the-commons.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-250wi&#34; style=&#34;width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In 2009, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia Page on Elinor Ostrom&#34;&gt;Elinor Ostrom&lt;/a&gt; received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her &lt;em&gt;“analysis of economic governance, especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia Page on The Commons&#34;&gt;the commons&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve seen a number of different versions of her list of the 8 principles for effectively managing against &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia Page for The Tragedy of the Commons&#34;&gt;the tragedy of the commons&lt;/a&gt;. However, I&amp;#39;ve found&amp;#0160;her original words — as well as many adaptions I&amp;#39;ve seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last weekend, at two very different events — one on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.futureofworking.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Future of Working Summit&#34;&gt;future of working&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and the other on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://crypto.sabir.cc/?page_id=237&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;future of the block chain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;(used by technologies like bitcoin) — I wanted to share these principles. However, I was unable to effectively articulate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#0160;I decided to take an afternoon to re-read the original, as well as more contemporary adaptions, to see if I could summarize this into a list of effective design principles. I also wanted to generalize them for broader use as I often apply them to everything from how to manage an online community to how a business should function with competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up with 10 principles, each beginning with a verb-oriented commandment, followed by the design principle itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINE BOUNDARIES:&lt;/strong&gt; There are clearly defined boundaries around the common resources of a system from the larger environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINE LEGITIMATE USERS:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a clearly defined community of legitimate users of those resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADAPT LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Rules for use of resources are adapted to local needs and conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DECIDE INCLUSIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; Those using resources are included in decision making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONITOR EFFECTIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; There exists effective monitoring of the system by accountable monitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE KNOWLEDGE:&lt;/strong&gt; All parties share knowledge of local conditions of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLD ACCOUNTABLE:&lt;/strong&gt; Have graduated sanctions for those who violate community rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OFFER MEDIATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer cheap and easy access to confict resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOVERN LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Community self-determination is recognized by higher-level authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T EXTERNALIZE COSTS:&lt;/strong&gt; Resource systems embedded in other resource systems are organized in and accountable to multiple layers of nested communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I welcome your thoughts on ways to improve on this summarized list. In particular, in #10 I&amp;#39;d like to find a better way to express its complexity (the original is even more obtuse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I love it Chris.  Our conversation this morning was about playing the role of the &#34;translator.&#34;  You work fast.
Quick notes:
#7 has a typo (sanction).
Could number 10 be rephrased as Internalize Externalities? (that may be even more abstract)
And at what level is ten really about feedback loops&gt; -- particularly since resources actual &#34;cost&#34; can be hard to even estimate, particularly when those resources are the result of thousands of years of natural processes (ex: oil, or fertile soil).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Christopher, let me suggest the following revisions to items 3, 5, and 10, based on:
Cox, M., G. Arnold, and S. Villamayor Tomás. 2010. A review of design principles for community-based natural resource management. Ecology and Society 15(4): 38. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol15/iss4/art38/
3.  ESTABLISH LOCALLY　APPROPRIATE RULES　FOR　USING AND MAINTAINING RESOURCES: Rules for use and maintenance of resources are adapted to local needs and conditions, and provide benefits to users that are correlated to their level of inputs.
5.  EFFECTIVELY MONITOR RESOURCES AND USERS: There exists effective monitoring of the system by monitors who are accountable to the users.
10. TIE-IN TO RELATED SYSTEMS: The resource system is appropriately connected to parent/fraternal/subordinate resource groups and to governmental systems.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Excellent version. I think a critical adaptation is the active voice, as you&#39;ve done in the bold verbs.
#10 expresses a dynamic relationship with #9, yes? Thus, &#34;govern locally&#34; (or &#34;organize locally&#34;) is in relation to &#34;don&#39;t externalize costs.&#34; That is, within holarchies or (spatially, temporally, institutionally) nested set of commons or jurisdictions, both other levels and other holarchies are recognized and respected. Perhaps the positive flip on &#34;don&#39;t externalize costs&#34; would be &#34;seek to externalize benefits&#34;? In other words, seek to transmit one&#39;s learnings from such local organization up the holarchy and across to other holarchies. Like Ostrom did, and one seeks to do, by developing design principles!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mini Resume Card for Conference Season</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/03/mini-resume-card-for-conference-season.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 23:55:42 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/03/mini-resume-card-for-conference-season.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between the business of the March/April conference season and leaving Blackphone, I&#39;ve run out of business cards. Rather than rush to print a bunch of new ones, I&#39;m created this mini-resume for digital sharing and a two-sided Avery business card version that I am printing on my laser printer and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not as pretty as my old Life With Alacrity cards, but effective in getting across the diversity of my professional experience and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; style=&#34;display: inline; border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; border-color: black;&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d0f2961e970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d0f2961e970c image-full img-responsive&#34; title=&#34;Christopher Allen Micro Resume&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d0f2961e970c-800wi&#34; alt=&#34;Christopher Allen Micro Resume&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who teaches Personal Branding in my courses at BGI@Pinchot.edu, I always find it hard to practice as I preach to ask for advice and suggestions. In this case I&#39;m trying to tame my three-headed Cerebus of a profession with Privacy/Crypto/Developer Community, an Innovative Business Educator/Instructional Designer head, and my Collaborative Tools, Processes, Games and Play head. All come tied together in my body as ultimately being about collaboration, but it is hard to explain some of the correspondences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep Context Shared Languages</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2014/06/deep-context-shared-languages.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 20:58:04 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2014/06/deep-context-shared-languages.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Opening Scene of Darmok, STtNG S05E02&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Opening Scene of Darmok, STtNG S05E02&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you consider yourself a futurist or an agent of change, you should read this article from The Atlantic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Shaka, When the Walls Fall&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, it uses a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok&#34;&gt;Star Trek episode&lt;/a&gt; as an allegory, it is a bit confusing and has a lot of complexity and depth, but it is a good introduction to a topic I care about — &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Context Shared Languages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I consider one of my missions in life to be to &amp;quot;create tools that allow people to communicate about complexity&amp;quot;. There are many problems to address and many possible solutions to those problems. My &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/InfiniteCanvasSuite/&#34;&gt;Infinite Canvas Suite&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;app tries&amp;#0160;to address problems of linearity. Another way to manage complexity is facilitating the creation and learning of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2009/09/creating-shared-language-and-shared-artiifacts.html&#34;&gt;Shared Languages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Some of what Shared Language is is tribal — it has an elemental power to help a group form. But what a shared language also does is allow a group to take shortcuts. For instance, with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/GroupWorksDeck/&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;Group Works Deck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pattern Language, I can say the phrase &amp;quot;Viewpoint Shift&amp;quot; and practitioners know that I mean &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Step from your usual perspective into another in order to better understand someone, shift energy, reframe meanings, open up new ideas, or simply see a situation with new eyes.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; But they also know more than that — they can connect that concept to their own experience of doing this practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;The first time I was introduced to this concept was by expert facilitator and futurist &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/RMattTaylor&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;Matt Taylor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has in his communities a Shared Language concept called a &amp;quot;Glass Bead Game&amp;quot;, which is from a story by Herman Hess. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game&#34;&gt;Wikipedia cites it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;The Glass Bead Game is &amp;quot;a kind of synthesis of human learning&amp;quot; in which themes, such as a musical phrase or a philosophical thought, are stated. As the Game progresses, associations between the themes become deeper and more varied.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-75wi&#34; style=&#34;width: 60px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When you know the shared language of Matt&amp;#39;s community, you can express concisely &amp;quot;In the SOLUTION BOX I am at INSIGHT, PHILOSOPHY and SCHEMATIC DESIGN.&amp;quot; Which means, in other words, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I have a mature idea that I feel is a synthesis of all the challenges inherent in the project, I can talk about it with some clarity and express it as a visual solution. I have done a lot of work yet I do not have a buildable design.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Someone familiar with the language can then respond in kind, rather than coming from a different perspective in the solution box and think that I have built something that is ready for production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Sometimes hash tags are a more contemporary expression that there may exist a Deep Context. For instance, just saying &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/glassbeadgame?source=feed_text&amp;amp;story_id=10152490318630540&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s3&#34;&gt;#‎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s4&#34;&gt;GlassBeadGame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a challenge for someone to respond in kind with a model of their own. Hash tags like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/intrapreneuring?source=feed_text&amp;amp;story_id=10152490318630540&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s3&#34;&gt;#‎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s4&#34;&gt;Intrapreneuring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freedomtofail?source=feed_text&amp;amp;story_id=10152490318630540&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s3&#34;&gt;#‎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s4&#34;&gt;FreedomToFail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also have&amp;#0160;Deep Contexts with different communities. If someone says to me &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cynefin?source=feed_text&amp;amp;story_id=10152490318630540&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s3&#34;&gt;#‎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s4&#34;&gt;Cynefin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I know that we share an understanding with me about the difference between &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;complicated&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; &lt;/a&gt;and how to work with each.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;So what makes for great deep context shared languages? I don&amp;#39;t know, but this article touches on it. It is more than just metaphor, more than allegory, more than meme. But if we can figure out how to create and teach it, it may be a powerful tool for communicating about complexity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;Here we might distinguish between the invocation of a particular logic and the simulation of a creature, thing, or idea by replicating its image. The simulation of life in art often concerns the reproduction of surfaces: in painting, the appearance of form, perspective, or the rendition of light; in literature the appearance of character or event; in photography and cinema the rendition of the world as it appears through optical element and upon emulsion or sensor; in theater the rendition of the behavior of a character or situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;While all these examples “simulate” to various extents, they do so by a process of rendering. For example, the writer might simulate a convincing verbal intercourse by producing a credibility that allows the reader to take it as reality. Likewise, the actor might render a visible behavior or intonation that is suggestive of a particular emotion, event, or history that the theatrical or cinematic viewer takes as evidence for some unseen motivation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;A logic is also a behavior, but it is a behavior unlike the behavior of the literary or theatrical character, for whom behaving involves producing an outward sign of some deeper but abstracted motivation, understanding, or desire. By contrast logics are pure behaviors. They are abstract and intangible and yet also real.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;If we pretend that “Shaka, when the walls fell” is a signifier, then its signified&amp;#0160;not by the fictional mythological character Shaka, nor the myth that contains whatever calamity caused the walls to fall, but the logic by which the situation itself came about. Tamarian language isn’t really language at all, but machinery.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another post about Shared Language:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dyads &amp; Triads — The Smallest Teams</title>
      <link>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2013/04/dyads-triads-the-smallest-teams.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2013 14:16:52 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2013/04/dyads-triads-the-smallest-teams.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(by Christopher Allen with Elyn Andersson and Shannon Appelcline)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.BGI.edu&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;BGIedu Logo&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;100&#34; src=&#34;http://www.bgi.edu/files/BGI-Logomark-CMYK.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; width=&#34;100&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Two years ago, the Bainbridge Graduate Institute (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.BGI.edu&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Bainbridge Graduate Institute&#34;&gt;www.BGI.edu&lt;/a&gt;) faculty gathered to radically reinvent their sustainable business curriculum for the next decade. Our goal was not only to update course content, but also to significantly update how the material was taught. We wished to make our teaching process (our pedagogy) more interactive and also more effective for students graduating into a 21st-century work environment, where people increasingly work in teams-both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a specialist in group interactions, I was asked by the faculty whether formal graduate student study groups (called &amp;quot;Study Buddies&amp;quot;) should consist of two people or of three. I did not have an easy answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My expertise with group dynamics comes from professional experience as an entrepreneur and from considerable experience both building online communities and helping others to do the same. Through these processes, I&amp;#39;ve seen how groups of people act differently at different sizes. As I discussed in my previous blog post on Group Thresholds [&lt;a href=&#34;#Allen&#34;&gt;Allen&lt;/a&gt;], there are pros and cons associated with different group sizes. However, the smallest group that I spoke of in that article was the &amp;#39;working team size&amp;#39;, which is a group of four to nine members (but ideally about seven). I didn&amp;#39;t talk about groups consisting of less than four members-specifically dyads (a group of two people) and triads (a group of three people)-and that was what the BGIedu faculty was now interested in learning more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first inclination when considering BGIedu&amp;#39;s request was to say that triads would be the best size for study groups, but I wasn&amp;#39;t sure. I knew from my past research on group size that a dyad has a significantly different behavior than any other small groups. However, I wasn&amp;#39;t certain if triads should also be considered on their own, or if they were just the low end of one of those &amp;#39;work teams&amp;#39;, which I&amp;#39;d always thought of as containing four to nine members. Triads were a hole in my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to dig deeper into this question by engaging my teaching assistant Elyn Andersson and my writing partner Shannon Appelcline to help me investigate further. This post is the fruit of our research and our discussions about dyads and triads. We hope it might help you decide whether a dyad or a triad is the better team size for groups that you are working in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;choosing&#34; name=&#34;choosing&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Choosing between Dyads and Triads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-800wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Before I share with you the details of our investigation, I want to be clear that dyads, triads, and small &amp;#39;working team&amp;#39; groups can all be effective. Any challenge faced by groups of these sizes can be overcome by a good process, teamwork, training, or just positive energy. However, my thesis is that certain sizes of groups are better for certain purposes-and when a group size is selected appropriately it will require less energy and thus be more likely to be productive when the inevitable group challenges occur. When choosing among a dyad, a triad, or a working team, the important thing to focus on is thus the intent in forming the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the groups being considered by BGIedu, the faculty felt that the students taking the new curriculum needed three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More formal support for studying (i.e. not ad hoc study teams);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of emotional support in that support structure; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system where the members of a study group would help each other to keep their commitments to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last requirement - that members of these study teams would be accountable to each other without one student just taking up the slack of another - was the toughest one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, working teams of 4-9 people were too large for our purposes. Teams this size are rarely intimate enough to support the needs of individuals. In addition, research shows that they are poor at supporting accountability. That&amp;#39;s because working teams of 4-9 are very vulnerable to social loafing (i.e., slackers)-except when the tasks assigned to these working teams are highly independent (i.e. an entrepreneurial team that has different members focused on different topics, such as management, development, operations, marketing and sales) or when they require high diversity. An upcoming blog will cover this topic in more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-800wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Removing working teams left the question of dyad vs. triad - which our research would show were both very different from working teams. Triads ultimately fit BGIedu&amp;#39;s particular need better. That was primarily due to advantages of accountability and cohesion, combined with some emotional support. However, some simple numerical properties of triads also prove useful: they have elemental diversity because they&amp;#39;re up to 50% more diverse than dyads; and if someone misses a team meeting the other two-thirds of the team can still benefit. For all of these reasons, my recommendation to the BGIedu faculty was that these formal study teams be formed in triads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyads, however, are quite appropriate for a variety of other purposes, and should not be dismissed. I&amp;#39;ll be talking of some of their advantages before proceeding on to the lessons learned about triads themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;dyad&#34; name=&#34;dyad&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Dyad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has had experience with dyads. The first social experience of anyone&amp;#39;s life is a dyadic relationship - that between a mother and her unborn child. This parent-child relationship continues once the child is born. Overall, dyads are the most common social group; they are seen everywhere, in personal, academic and business relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/94611163@N00/683866337/&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Great Guitar Duo — Photo by Tom706 CC-BY-NC-ND&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1108/683866337_4dd654b650_n.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To decide if a dyad is the best group size for your needs, it is again important to focus on the purpose of the group. A number of interesting characteristics of dyads - some benefits and some limitations - make them unique from triads and other larger group sizes, among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional Support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commitment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasoned Agreement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Inequality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group Accountability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;emotional_support&#34; name=&#34;emotional_support&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Emotional Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some academic studies [&lt;a href=&#34;#Taylor&#34;&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt;] that suggest that it&amp;#39;s easier to be open and share within dyads. The research has shown that people feel safer about revealing personal and intimate information in a dyad than they do when a third person is added to the group. As a result, disclosure rates increase when people are put into dyads as compared to triads. Furthermore, adding a third person to a group causes its members to be more socially conscious, making it harder for members to listen to the conversation and at the same time be aware of their own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together it&amp;#39;s this trust level (allowing for disclosure) and this focus level (allowing for better listening) that make dyads much stronger for emotional support than triads or larger teams. If the intent of a group is to have an intimate and fully open space, or if the work of the group is emotional in nature, this might make dyads a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though dyads are clearly more effective for providing emotional support, triads can still offer that as well under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;commitment&#34; name=&#34;commitment&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Commitment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intimacy and confidentiality of a dyad helps its members to build strong team dynamics relatively quickly. The two individuals not only will have formed a trust bond more easily than three or more individuals could, but they generally will have a better ratio of time to performance outcomes compared to groups of larger sizes, in part because less time is spent maintaining the team relationship itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a triad or larger group, the group would need to put effort towards team work over task work and thus less time is put towards performing the task. In other words, more resources would be spent on relating to a teammate than on finishing a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;reasoned_agreement&#34; name=&#34;reasoned_agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reasoned Agreement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most unique element of dyads is that they are the only group size in which one voice is paired against another voice equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you were in dyad in which you did not agree on an issue? Most likely, you and the other individual spent some considerable time trying to convince the other of your reasons, and the outcome was one of two things: you either both stuck with your opinion and walked away, or one of you changed your mind after hearing the other&amp;#39;s ideas and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because members can&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;vote&amp;#39;, a dyad is either in agreement or disagreement, which forces a longer deliberation for tasks when consensus is required. There are times when you want a small group to deliberate deeply, and dyads are ideal for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;power_inequality&#34; name=&#34;power_inequality&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Power Inequality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though dyads have several advantages, they can also bring with them a few additional problems - one of which is a power inequality of knowledge that would be detrimental within some teams. For some tasks, this could offset the benefits of having a more intimate small group. For my BGIedu groups, I was concerned that it might prevent some students from benefiting academically from the study exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic has been addressed in a study &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604000972&#34;&gt;[&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Day&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Day&#34;&gt;Day&lt;/a&gt;] that compared homogeneous teams that were entirely high-ability or low-ability to heterogeneous dyads of mixed abilities. The study found that while high-ability people tested better individually after learning the material in a dyad with another high-ability team mate, low-ability people did not gain much benefit from studying in a dyad with a high-ability team member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was somewhat surprising. A student with more knowledge of a subject should be able to mentor a student with less knowledge, therefore creating a true dyad study partner. However, this study showed that this was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also argued against another common conception. One might assume that two high-ability team members could learn more together, when they could bounce ideas off of each other, than they could alone. However, this was again not the case: high-ability individuals performed better after learning alone than after learning with another high-ability team member! Only homogeneous low-ability teammates performed better after being in a dyad than alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study pushed me toward triads for study teams at BGIedu, as dyads would not be large enough to guarantee high performance outcomes; the teams would always consist of one higher performing student and one lower performing student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;group_accountability&#34; name=&#34;group_accountability&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Group Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another disadvantage of dyads shows up in the area of accountability. The simplest version of this issue can be shown in this question: if one teammate says she did the majority of the work, while the other teammate says the work was shared 50/50, who was correct? A tougher question: if they both say that the work was shared 50/50, how is a third party able to determine if this actually was true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elyn, my teaching assistant, interned in a high school in Seattle while working towards her Master&amp;#39;s in Teaching. Her experiences highlight this problem. In today&amp;#39;s educational model, collaborative learning is highly valued, and Elyn worked to incorporate in-class group work into many of her lessons. When assessing the students&amp;#39; group projects, however, she found that it was difficult to determine if the students shared the work equitably or if some of the students rode on the hard work of their partners. In some cases, Elyn doubted that the work was split equally. In particular, she found that if she let the students choose their own partners, the students were more likely to say that &amp;#39;both&amp;#39; did the work, rather than tell the teacher their friend slacked off on the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study [&lt;a href=&#34;#Alkaslassy&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Alkaslassy&lt;/a&gt;]&amp;#0160;supports Elyn&amp;#39;s experience. In it, students working on a paired group assignment were asked to allocate the percent of work done between the pair. 86% of the students assigned equal credit between the two individuals in the group. At a surface level, one could presume that each party performed half the work and was honest in their assignment of credit. However, Elyn and I believe that in some dyadic relationships, friendship can become an overriding factor and that in those situations, students are more likely to allocate equal credit because of this friendship, not because of true equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the psychological field, this relates to a well-known cognitive bias called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_bias&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia: Egocentric Bias&#34;&gt;egocentric bias&lt;/a&gt;, where an individual will claim more responsibility for group action then an independent observer would credit them. Although this is most often discussed for larger groups, in dyads a member might rate their own efforts as being half of the effort when in fact is it is less. Thus in academic group projects, it can sometimes be more effective to have the students rate their peer rather than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though group accountability can be a disadvantage for dyads, it improves when you have triads, thanks in part to a triad&amp;#39;s inability to devolve. This, as it turns out, would be another comparative advantage that helped me choose triads over dyads for BGIedu.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ll talk about three of them in this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inability to Devolve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elemental Diversity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;inability_to_devolve&#34; name=&#34;inability_to_devolve&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inability to Devolve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have experienced what happens when a party gets too busy or too noisy - the size of the conversation groups get smaller. If you are having an informal dinner for seven, sometimes the conversation will include the entire table. However while people are eating the conversation will typically devolve into smaller groups: four people at one end of the table will being having one conversation, while the remaining three will be talking at the end other. Sometimes one person will be left out of any conversation, but studies show that with small groups this is less likely to happen. We have a natural tendency not to want to exclude or reject individuals unjustly, so such a singleton will usually find a place in one conversation or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working teams also have this natural tendency to devolve when confronted with external challenges (of which noise is one of the simpler ones) or internal challenges (such as differences of opinion), only reuniting when those challenges are resolved. A team of six can devolve gracefully a number of different ways: a three and a three; a four and a two; or three groups of two. Teams of five can devolve into teams of two and three. A team of four can devolve into two teams of two. In all of these cases the devolution does not exclude any individual&amp;#39;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a triad can not devolve without excluding someone. Triads thus have a lot of subtle pressure to try to keep the group together, so that no individual is explicitly rejected - except for a good reason. This leads to more accountability for the individuals in the group, compared to teams of two where the dyadic nature of the group can override liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;voting&#34; name=&#34;voting&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Unconscious Voting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dyad&amp;#39;s inability to vote was an advantage of that group size, and thus issues that require deeper deliberation are often better with dyads. However, you sometimes don&amp;#39;t want as much deliberation. You want fast action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that we unconsciously gauge each others&amp;#39; opinions in a small group very quickly, and even more so with a triad. This means that a triad seems to be able to come to at least some decision very fast. There are many cases where this can be very useful - if that is the intent of your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an personal example, I saw a presentation in the early 1990s from the Apple Human Interface Group (HIG) about their survey of how users colored &amp;quot;folders&amp;quot; on the Macintosh. The result was that there was little commonality - everyone colored folders differently for different reasons. Afterward, I met with the team and suggested that that if they instead asked teams of three to decide how to color code folders that they used together, then the results from all the different teams would have much more commonality. This suggestion ended up getting me a consulting job with Apple HIG, and shows how a triad can quickly create successful performance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triads are not the only group size that can vote easily - all odd size groups can - but I believe the voting of a triad to be fundamentally different because the voting can be so unconscious and informal that the members are not even aware of it. This can be useful, but it can also cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was just starting my business, I was doing a lot of work with a company formed by two partners who had a 50/50 stock split in their company. Theirs was a good partnership; they had very different but complementary skills and worked well and profitably together. As a fellow entrepreneur, I was a peer to both them, and we were developing a new product line together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I worked with them on this product line, I saw that I&amp;#39;d changed their very successful dyad to a triad, and I thus became a tiebreaker in many of their business decisions - including business decisions on issues that had nothing to do with our joint product. This was caused by a shift in power: one partner might ask me a question about marketing rather than asking his partner (who knew marketing), and then it would become our opinion against the remaining partner&amp;#39;s. Conversely, I found the marketing partner asking me to side with him on development questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this quite troubling; a more manipulative person could have controlled or broken that relationship by always breaking the ties in their own favor. In our case, we never shipped the product line and went our separate ways. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but think it might have been because my unofficial &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot; was causing problems in their partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When getting a result is the purpose of a team, a triad is better than a dyad as it allows for this voting to take place. As I mentioned to BGIedu, a triad can have a two-to-one vote, allowing a better chance at task accomplishment. Task accomplishment is also achieved because triads stay on topic better than dyads due of this voting ratio: if one member of a dyad decides to go off topic, it is easy for the other to follow his or her lead. In a a triad, two out of the three members would need to &amp;#39;agree&amp;#39; to follow an unrelated discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;elemental_diversity&#34; name=&#34;elemental_diversity&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Elemental Diversity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final advantage of triads when compared to dyads is that the knowledge base of the group is larger. I saw this issue clearly in my recent Social Web for Social Change class at BGIedu, where I changed the team size from two to three, and immediately saw a growth in elemental diversity that benefited the groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this class, I have the students participate in an exercise on personal branding. I originally had the students pair up in teams of two, effectively giving each student a &amp;#39;branding buddy&amp;#39; to help them form their personal brand and to give and receive feedback. In the last year, however, I decided to change this dyad to a triad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, these groups followed the same methods I used for dyads: one person would self-brand themselves to a second person in the group, who would then echo back what they thought they heard the first person say, using their own words. However, it is difficult for two people to really hear the similarities and differences between what they said and what they heard. The third person thus became a neutral sounding board who told both individuals that spoke what they said. Together, all three could figure out the similarities and differences between the statements. After consensus is reached, all three students switch roles. I call this the Echo Exercise, and it shows how triads can be beneficial at times when the natural characteristics of dyads don&amp;#39;t lead to optimum results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;finalnotes&#34; name=&#34;finalnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Final Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Tripal Spiral —&amp;#0160;from Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; width=&#34;160&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As it happens, this article was created by a triad. It wasn&amp;#39;t purposeful, nor was it meant to show off the findings of this article. Instead, the triad evolved naturally because it proved the best group size for writing this piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with the initial concept for the article and wrote out the problem and introduction. Elyn then did considerable research and wrote up a rough draft of her findings. To that point, we were a committed dyad, working together in an organic way. However, we also had an article that felt like it was in two parts. That&amp;#39;s when I had Shannon join us. He reorganized the article, unified its voice, and produced a final draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it wasn&amp;#39;t purposeful, you can see the advantages of triads just from this example. Most notably, our triad made great use of elemental diversity. Though I held the core ideas and concepts for the article, Elyn provided the research expertise and Shannon provided the editorial expertise that were required to complete it. Voting also came into the equation (in the unconscious way that it tends to in triads) when Shannon effectively &amp;quot;broke the tie&amp;quot; of two different writing styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, this triad has fallen apart. It&amp;#39;s something that was created for a specific project and with all of our other tasks, we didn&amp;#39;t have room for it going forward. Teams breaking apart is natural. Sometimes it happens under normal conditions (as was the case with this triad), and sometimes it happens as a result of unhealthy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not give BGIedu any advice at the time about the termination of a team, although it will eventually come up: some teams will end badly, and members of these groups may leave with an impression that a triad is a bad group size, even though the size did not lead the group to ending in an unhealthy way. Perhaps the groups should be counseled, or perhaps the members should jump right back on the triad horse ... but that&amp;#39;s a topic for another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, I&amp;#39;d like to open the conversation up to you. Have you had experiences in either dyads or triads that you would like to share? Were you one of the BGIedu students in a Study Buddy triad? Did the experiences match the studies shown here or did you have an experience that differed? We invite your comments.&lt;/p&gt;

I just discovered your site, and I&#39;m really enjoying your posts.
I am an Organizational Leadership student through Fort Hays State University, and this is a fascinating topic.
I can definitely see the point of the disadvantage of voting. Dyads are forced to use consensus decision-making, unless the power differential is so wide that unilateral decisions are made by the dyad&#39;s autocrat.
Consensus, of course, can take a little longer, but being the default for the Dyad, it makes disagreements automatically covert into brainstorming sessions to find solutions that satisfy both parties. Often, these solutions will be creative and superior to either original idea.
Triads, by virtue of the odd number, CAN employ democracy to make decisions, but the question is-- SHOULD they? A Triad can still opt to employ consensus. If it chooses democracy, it can speed decisions, but there is no requirement for democracy to govern the Triad&#39;s decisions. If they opt for consensus, they can once more engage in creative problem-solving that satisfies all parties.
A consensus-based Triad has all the other advantages of a Triad, without the down-side.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are the initial required readings for the first two weeks of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bgi.edu/changing-business/social-web-for-social-change/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Using the Social Web for Social Change&lt;/a&gt; class (hashtag #SW4SX) that I teach in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/hybrid-mba/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;MBA in Sustainable Systems&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;program at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bgi.edu&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Bainbridge Graduate Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this portion of the class is to&amp;#0160;cover an introduction and overview of the landscape of the Social Web, establish among the students the beginning of a shared language about the medium, and introduce a process toward a collaborative culture that we will use for the rest of the course. Students are also kicking off their Beat blogs on sustainability topics, with the goal of helping them move toward having an authentic online voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC: New Ways of Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I designed this class four years ago, I was inspired by Michael Wesch&amp;#39;s class at Kansas State University. This is a shared artifact created by his class that I use to set the stage for my own students.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC: Shared Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language. They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: “Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something…However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact…It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: &amp;quot;Is this what you mean when…&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ARTICLE:&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1659772,00.html&#34;&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1659772,00.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t people just say what they mean? The reason is that conversational partners are not modems downloading information into each other&amp;#39;s brains. People are very, very touchy about their relationships. Whenever you speak to someone, you are presuming the two of you have a certain degree of familiarity--which your words might alter. So every sentence has to do two things at once: convey a message and continue to negotiate that relationship.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;Shared Language is a prerequisite to collaboration. Without Shared Language, we can’t collaborate. It’s as simple as that. When a group tries to collaborate without having Shared Language, the group will try to create it, whether it’s aware of it or not. This creation process is often frustrating and painful, and as a result, people sometimes try to skip this step or belittle the process. This is a problem. You can’t skip this step.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC: Introduction to the Social Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what is the Social Web? It is Social Networks of people having conversations; Who are sharing Social Media; It functions using Social Software applications; And takes advantage of the toolchest of open technologies called Web 2.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;The big trend I&amp;#39;m seeing in the future of communications is actually using the social network to share, to be more productive in the work environment, and to do more expression, organizing, creativity, in social and civic context. We&amp;#39;re just in the early stages of the enabling technology to make that happen, how to make that happen technically, and how to make it happen socially so that we can use our social networks and use our groups as a foundation for doing really interesting, productive, and creative things.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ABSTRACT: &amp;quot;While news from Iran streams to the world, Clay Shirky shows how Facebook, Twitter and TXTs help citizens in repressive regimes to report on real news, bypassing censors (however briefly). The end of top-down control of news is changing the nature of politics.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;The term &amp;#39;social software&amp;#39;, which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush&amp;#39;s ideas about &amp;#39;memex&amp;#39; in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. By examining the many terms used to describe today&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;social software&amp;#39; we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how there exists a very real life cycle concerning the use of technical terminology.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;QUOTE: &amp;quot;Social media has become an integral part of modern society.&amp;#0160;There are general social networks with user bases larger than the population of most countries. There are niche sites for virtually every special interest out there. There are sites to share photos, videos, status updates, sites for meeting new people and sites to connect with old friends. It seems there are social solutions to just about every need. In this article, we’ll review the history and evolution of social media from its humble beginnings to the present day.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;Be Safe: None of these approaches is perfect, but they significantly raise the bar against any but the most determined cracker from breaking into one of your accounts. The domain letter technique will also make it very difficult for a cracker to break into your more important financial accounts if he gets access to your password from a poorly secured website or masquerades as a legitimate website or email by using a phishing attack.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

They may also like to pass around links to Web sites that relate to, and may refute, a speaker&amp;#39;s point. For them, wireless technology allows a back channel of communication, a second track that reveals their thoughts and feedback and records it all for future reference.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;My thoughts have now gelled sufficiently to make some observations about privacy. When people speak about privacy, they may actually be talking about very different forms of privacy: defensive privacy, human-rights privacy, personal privacy, and contextual privacy.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Madden, Mary &amp;quot;Privacy management on social media sites: Summary of Findings&amp;quot; Pew Internet 2012-02-24
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Privacy-management-on-social-media/Summary-of-findings.aspx&#34;&gt;http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Privacy-management-on-social-media/Summary-of-findings.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;Social media users who are college graduates are significantly more likely than those with lower levels of education to say that they experience some difficulty in managing the privacy controls on their profiles.&amp;#0160;…&amp;#0160;11% of SNS users have posted content they regret.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Consumer Reports &amp;quot;Facebook &amp;amp; your privacy —&amp;#0160;Who sees the data you share on the biggest social network?&amp;quot; Consumer Reports Magazone, 2012-06
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARTICLE:&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/06/facebook-your-privacy/index.htm&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/06/facebook-your-privacy/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABSTRACT: &amp;quot;How much information is really being collected about you? How is it being used? And could it fall into the wrong hands?&amp;#0160;To find out, we queried Facebook and interviewed some two dozen others, including security experts, privacy lawyers, app developers, and victims of security and privacy abuse. We dug into private, academic, and government research, as well as Facebook’s labyrinthian policies and controls. And we surveyed 2,002 online households, including 1,340 that are active on Facebook, for our annual State of the Net report. We then projected those data to estimate national totals.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;It is easy to become unsettled by privacy-eroding aspects of awareness tools. But there is another — quite different — result of all this incessant updating: a culture of people who know much more about themselves. Many of the avid Twitterers, Flickrers and Facebook users I interviewed described an unexpected side-effect of constant self-disclosure. The act of stopping several times a day to observe what you’re feeling or thinking can become, after weeks and weeks, a sort of philosophical act. It’s like the Greek dictum to “know thyself,” or the therapeutic concept of mindfulness. (Indeed, the question that floats eternally at the top of Twitter’s Web site — “What are you doing?” — can come to seem existentially freighted. What are you doing?) Having an audience can make the self-reflection even more acute, since, as my interviewees noted, they’re trying to describe their activities in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting to others: the status update as a literary form.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;KEYPOINTS: &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t launch until the blog is properly setup. Pick a topic and stick with it. Be consistent. Don&amp;#39;t leave your readers stranded. Get to the point. Spice it up. Don&amp;#39;t expect the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;VanFossen, Lorelle &amp;quot;Are You Really Writing For Your Blog Audience?&amp;quot; The Blog Herald, 2007-05-04
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BLOGPOST:&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogherald.com/2007/05/04/are-you-really-writing-for-your-blog-audience/&#34;&gt;&amp;#0160;http://www.blogherald.com/2007/05/04/are-you-really-writing-for-your-blog-audience/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;Think about how the trendy, jargon, national, and regional references you use in your blog may be misunderstood or even confuse your blog readers. It’s critical for bloggers to be “understood”, so take time to look at what you write and how your writing may create a disconnect with your readers.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;BLOGPOST:&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2004-November/011224.html&#34;&gt;http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2004-November/011224.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEYQUOTE: &amp;quot;One thing we should keep in mind when writing here or in any online forum is that we are writing not only for the present, but for the future. Our words may well be read many times, even far into the future. They are recorded in public and private archives and will be available indefinitely. Given the likely increase in future levels of intelligence and attention, it may even turn out that more eyes see our writings in the far future than in the near present.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I welcome your thoughts for additional or replacement Social Web introductory readings that we can use in the next class in the Spring of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
