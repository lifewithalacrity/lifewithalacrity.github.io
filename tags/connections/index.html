<div class="p-summary">In yesterday's All Things Considered, NPR commentator Jake Halpern questions why you feel like you have a relationship with the characters in your favorite TV shows. His answer: &quot;That's because you do.&quot; This idea is interesting not just to help us understand how we relate to imaginary characters, but also to correlate with our own understanding of Dunbar Number relationship limits and how they might relate to this concept. In his commentary, Bostonian Jake Halpern considers two academic ideas, &quot;belongingness theory&quot; and &quot;para-social relationships&quot;, and how they affect the relationships we develop with television characters.</div>

<h2><a class="p-name u-url" href='https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html'> Dunbar Triage: Too Many Connections</a> </h2>

<div class="p-summary">As someone who now has over 171 professional &quot;connections&quot; in my LinkedIn Profile, 198 &quot;friends&quot; on Orkut, many more non-intersecting friends and acquaintances on&nbsp; &nbsp;Tribe.Net, LiveJournal, and other social networking services, as well as a plethora of correspondents that I only interact with via email, I am trying reconcile a mismatch between my connections and my own Dunbar Number. How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people? Venture Capitalist Jeff Nolan relates similar concerns: &quot;It strikes me that the social networking theory holds that the more volume you have, the bigger your network will become by introducing degrees of separation roughly along the lines of Metcalfe's Law.</div>

<div class="p-summary">I have now had CEOs of three different social networks send me emails asking me to compare Orkut to their service. I've not had a chance to dig deeply into good answers for each specific one, but I did have some general advice that I wanted to offer given my recent experiences with Orkut.com, and my evaluation and followup on various social networking services in December. Privacy First, be extremely careful about privacy issues.</div>

<div class="p-summary">Like many others, I've been paying attention to Orkut in the last couple of weeks. I've answered more requests to be &quot;friends&quot; on Orkut then I have of any of the other half-dozen Social Networking Services I've tried, and I've looking at other people's friends to see if I know anyone. I've yet to ask someone to join Orkut that wasn't already a member, and I've been careful to not have anyone as a &quot;friend&quot; that I didn't know reasonably well and I thought knew me.</div>
