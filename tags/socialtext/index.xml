      <description>For the last several months I&#39;ve been working on a new open source project that I&#39;ve been calling SynchroEdit. SynchroEdit is a browser-based simultaneous multiuser editor, useful for &amp;quot;same-time&amp;quot; collaboration.

      <description>I&#39;ve not just been spending time looking at social networking services, I&#39;ve also been digging deeper into wiki. I&#39;ve still got more to go, but some of these will be of interest to you if you are considering implementing a wiki for your community, or if you are a wiki developer.
Zwiki is based on Zope, and thus has a very interesting feature set. One of the more popular features is the topic mappings that it creates.</description>
