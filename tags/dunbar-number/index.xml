      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldcafe.com/bank_book.htm&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Power of Conversation&#34; class=&#34;at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c &#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c-320wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was musing as I was preparing for next week&amp;#39;s Intensive at &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2009/09/teaching-using-the-social-web-for-social-change-at-bgiedu.html&#34;&gt;BGI&lt;/a&gt; that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That&amp;#39;s because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk about this a bit in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html&#34;&gt;Group Threshold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number&#34;&gt;“Judas Number”&lt;/a&gt; nadir, or low point. These group threshold nadirs exist when groups are too large for some processes to function effectively, but too small for others to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am particularly aware of this threshold when I host small parties at my home. At 7 or so people everything just seems to work — conversations flow, everybody gets to participate, and everyone has fun. A the numbers climb past 10 I find that I as the host have to work harder, to be more aware of making sure that everyone is having a good time and that no one is left out. At some point as a party gets larger things just begin to flow again, as there are enough people that small groups can form and conversation flows well once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also seen this at business meetings. When my entrepreneurial companies were small an “all hands” meeting could be incredibly effective. All the issues and ideas got brought up, and everyone felt committed to our decisions. However, as these meeting grew, at some point the “all hands” meeting took too long and started requiring process and rules to be effective. The energy this consumed also diminished much of the efficacy of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border=1&#34; title=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34; height=&#34;137&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2434/3959741597_77ffe2ca15_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: black; border-right-color: black; border-bottom-color: black; border-left-color: black; &#34; title=&#34;Card from Four Table Braid&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One tool that I&amp;#39;ve used to manage these odd-sized groups in the past is what I call “The Braid”. It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldcafe.com/&#34;&gt;The World Café&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.conversationcafe.org/&#34;&gt;Conversation Café&lt;/a&gt; are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldcafe.com/articles/cafetogo.pdf&#34;&gt;Cafe To Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Braid is a little more organized then the more ad-hoc Café Method. When you start a meeting you are given a small card that tells you which table to sit at for each round. Each table is assigned a scribe for each round to take notes at the table, and to report out the notes to everyone who arrives for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about the organization of The Braid is that over the course of a number of rounds you&amp;#39;ll have a brand new group of people to talk to during each round. Thus over the course of an hour or so you&amp;#39;ll actually get to have a relatively short yet rich conversation with almost everyone in the room, rather than with just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;amp;gid=0&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34; height=&#34;453&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/3960601974_652a29b96f.jpg&#34; width=&#34;433&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There are different forms of The Braid for different numbers of tables and sizes of groups, but my favorite is the Four Table Braid for groups of a minimum of 16 to a maximum of 28 people. One of the peculiar things about this Braid is that it seems to function well if people arrive at different times. The Braid fills first table A with 4 people so that they can begin talking, then fills table B, C, and D the same way. Once those tables are full, new arrivals are woven into The Braid one at a time until all tables have 5 people, then 6, then the max of 7 for a total of 28 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice thing about the Four Table Braid is that no one needs to be the scribe more then once; the task is equally shared among all but the last 8 to arrive in a group of 28. Also, in just 4 rounds with 16 people, 90%+ of the participants have met. With 28 people, you simply only need 5 rounds to match the same 90%+ meeting percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find The Braid useful for a variety of different situations. The simplest usage is as a group warming and introduction exercise. You need not do more then two or three rounds in order for more than half of the people to have met each other. The Braid is also useful with a focused objective. For instance, I once used it after a game designers&amp;#39; conference, with each table having a list of &amp;quot;game design laws&amp;quot; where the participants were asked to either give an example that was in favor of the law or contradicted the law. It also can be useful in combination with a variety of other group process techniques, for instance after an MG Taylor Take-A-Panel, where each participant first creates a page telling a story about themselves 15 years in the future and then the group uses The Braid to discover common insights. The Braid can also be good before an Open Space or other unconference event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am including here my templates for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf&#34;&gt;Four Table Braid&lt;/a&gt;. It includes 28 cards for printing on Avery business card paper, 4 table pages with instructions for participants, and 1 page with instructions for the host. I make these available as &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/&#34; rel=&#34;license&#34;&gt;CC-BY-NC-SA&lt;/a&gt; license. I welcome any DTP folks out there who would like to make these documents more functional or more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Three Table Braid is easy to figure out by hand, but larger Braids are more difficult. I&amp;#39;ve never figured out an algorithm for designing these quickly (any math wizzes out there?) so I&amp;#39;ve posted my &lt;a href=&#34;http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;amp;gid=0&#34;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; for the Four Table Braid for those of you who might wish to figure out how to implement larger numbers of tables. I would love to have a Ten Table Braid as a warm up exercise for a small unconference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Community by the Numbers, Part III: Power Laws</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2009/03/power-laws.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2009 01:46:36 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2009/03/power-laws.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/11/personal-circle.html&#34;&gt;my first article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;in this series I talked about community numbers: how the sizes of groups ultimately affect their success (or failure). However what I discussed only offers up the most rudimentary explanation of the dynamics, and that is because typically not all of the members of a group are equally involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better define &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; constitutes the tightly-knit &amp;quot;participant community&amp;quot; upon which the group thresholds act, we have to study power laws which let us measure the intensity of individuals&amp;#39; involvement in a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Overview of Power Laws&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366611997/&#34; title=&#34;Pareto Principle by ChristopherA, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pareto Principle&#34; height=&#34;179&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3616/3366611997_95f255e4a3_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The best-known power law is probably the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&#34;&gt;Pareto principle&lt;/a&gt;, which is otherwise known as the &amp;quot;80/20 law.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s been overused throughout the years; Pareto&amp;#39;s actual law only said that 80% of the wealth would be held by 20% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it offers a fine example of how power laws work. They generally describe a discrepancy between intensity and population: inevitably, some people do a lot more of the work in any social situation. Other examples include &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law&#34;&gt;Zipf&amp;#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367563212/&#34; title=&#34;Long Tail Curve by ChristopherA, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img height=&#34;174&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3603/3367563212_8aa7a62c6f_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;which suggests that the frequency of a word&amp;#39;s usage is inversely proportionate to its ranking among words (making the second ranked word appear half as much, the third a quarter as much, etc), and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail&#34;&gt;long tail&lt;/a&gt;, which talks about selling a very large number of items in a very small individual quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For online communities, which have been the focus of most of my studies on the topic of community sizes, I&amp;#39;ve found that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_inequality&#34;&gt;participation inequality&lt;/a&gt; power rule is very apt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366764093/&#34; title=&#34;Participation Inequality by ChristopherA, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Participation Inequality&#34; height=&#34;192&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3613/3366764093_29495ce5b4_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This term comes from Will Hill of AT&amp;amp;T Laboratories, who said, &amp;quot;A major reason why user-contributed content rarely turns into a true community is that all aspects of Internet use are characterized by severe participation inequality.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s often equated with the 1% law, though I like to be more precise and say that 90% of an online community tends to be lurkers, 9% tends to be intermittent participants, and 1% tends to be active participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These values heavily influence online community sizes that are larger than the tightly-knit communities group thresholds that I previously discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power Laws &amp;amp; Group Thresholds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wrote about tightly-knit communities in my first article, I didn&amp;#39;t consider the degree of participation. That&amp;#39;s certainly an entirely valid model for some types of groups. Corporations, for example, ideally should be entirely filled with active participants, while Skotos&amp;#39; online game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/&#34;&gt;Castle Marrach&lt;/a&gt; also fits into the category due to the implicit requirements it creates for participation. There are some challenges to grow this type of community, since you&amp;#39;re only searching for a specific type of high-energy participant — but they can be overcome if you offer sufficient incentive (such as a salary or a lot of internal feedback).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most communities, and in particular, online communities, will not fall into this category, and thus when we&amp;#39;re looking at group thresholds, we have to measure them against the number of &lt;em&gt;active participants&lt;/em&gt;, not against the number of total members. Thus, for groups which allow for non-participation, we&amp;#39;ll often measure 10% (or maybe 1%) of the group size against the group thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpg.net&#34;&gt;RPGnet&lt;/a&gt;, one of the community sites that Skotos runs, offers a good example of this. We regularly see monthly uniques of approximately 200,000 users. However we probably have about 20,000 active registered users, confirming the lurker:participant ratio. When we recognize that only 2,000 of those are particularly active participants and that they&amp;#39;re divided upon 6 successful forums, we start to see how community numbers that actually match the group thresholds can gel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reverse this approach and look at active participants first. During some recent consulting for a local non-profit organization with 60 active online members, I was able to infer that their broader community was around 6000, which turned out to fairly accurately predict the total number of people who came to their live events over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, this logic can be applied to a community of any size. You first measure whether it&amp;#39;s an all-participant community or one that matches an existing power law, and then you use the corrected community number to truly measure which of the group thresholds may apply to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power Laws &amp;amp; Leaders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power laws can also help you to measure the number of leaders in a community. Inevitably all of your participants will become leaders of some sort, while your high-level participants will become the top-tier leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noted this in my first discussions of group threshold. In a group of 7 members, you can reasonably expect to have one higher level participant, and thus the one leader that we saw naturally appear. Similarly in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number&#34;&gt;Judas group of 13&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;#39;s the opportunity for more than one leader to appear, creating the possibility for the first hierarchical conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609602/&#34; title=&#34;Participation Inequality 90 9 1 by ChristopherA, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Participation Inequality 90 9 1&#34; height=&#34;153&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3367609602_4445e5cfb9_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Understanding your count of leaders can help you see how to grow groups. For example when I first created &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iphonewebdev.com&#34;&gt;iPhoneWebDev&lt;/a&gt; I had to do an immense amount of effort to grow the community. This is because with Participation Inequality I had to grow the group by 10 members before I got the least amount of help increasing the content of the group and I had to grow it by 100 members before I had someone who was doing as much work as I was to create content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 100 members, with my first active participant, we continued to grow, but we were both were working hard and felt rather lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366786135/&#34; title=&#34;Participation Inequality 700 70 7 by ChristopherA, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Participation Inequality 700 70 7&#34; height=&#34;196&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3366786135_53f8ebcf47_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I finally saw the group stabilize, then take off on its own, when it hit 600-700 members, and that shows how beautifully the power logs work hand-in-hand with the group thresholds. With 700 members, I could reasonably expect there to be 7 leaders. In other words, I had a committee of leaders: the perfect size for a starting&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Working_Group&#34;&gt;working group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experience with other online groups, if the iPhoneWebDev grows to over 10,000 members, I can expect that there will be some transition issues. As the core active community members exceed 100 people I will start having some &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number&#34;&gt;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; problems, typically social contract failures. These can be solved by either adding some hierarchy (appointing some people to be official &amp;quot;staff&amp;quot;), or by starting to break the group into sub-communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Varying the Power Laws&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first article, I noted that it&amp;#39;s possible to expend additional energy to make tightly-knit groups able to function effectively at non-optimal sizes. It is similarly possible for the values of the participation inequality sized groups to change by expending more energy. Conversely, a drain on energy&amp;#0160;may decrease this ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609374/&#34; title=&#34;Participation Inequality - High Energy by ChristopherA, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Participation Inequality - High Energy&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3367609374_3975fe9bf7_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For example when I used to run AOL forums I would frequently reward first-time participants with free time (at that time worth $5 an hour) if they asked good questions or offered valuable input. CompuServe similarly offered constructive feedback by telling users how many responses they&amp;#39;d received to a new comment when they logged back in, encouraging them to leave lurker status. More energy in the community — driven either by the moderators, good social software design, or by a greater commitment by its members — can allow you to increase the active participant percentage, maybe times 2, or even 4, but even with a lot of effort not by an order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a group grows in size, I believe the participation inequality worsens. A huge Yahoo! group with a million members might have moved from a 90/9/1 ratio to 95/4.5/.5. I suspect this is because the energy required to change the participation inequality numbers is so large as to not be economical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some interesting interrelations between the numbers of people at the various levels of participation. Though discovering 100 new members has a good chance of adding 10 new participants, 1 of whom is very active, my experience has been that things trickle-down in the other direction as well: that adding 1 new high-level participant can lead to the creation of 9 medium-level participants and 90 lurkers (though don&amp;#39;t let that suggest that all of your effort should be expended on the high-level participants only).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking at Participation Inequality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a close look at four online communities, using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quantcast.com/&#34;&gt;quantcast.com&lt;/a&gt; metrics service, where you can see some participation inequality in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609306/&#34; title=&#34;Participation Inequality - quantcast.com by ChristopherA, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Participation Inequality - quantcast.com&#34; height=&#34;235&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3367609306_023c85652f_o.jpg&#34; width=&#34;961&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this you can see a typical online community site shows the normal 90% 9% 1% participation inequality. RPGnet shows a slightly better then average participation inequality due to its longevity and the quality of the community. ObesityHealth shows evidence of a great community with its 4% active participants, probably because you have to be very committed if you are going to have bariatric surgery. Last, an example of relatively&amp;#0160;unhealthy&amp;#0160;community that is unable to sustain its active participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do have to be careful when analyzing quantcast numbers if you see active participants of greater then 6% — in almost all cases if you look deeper it is because there is some restriction that keeps people from lurking, either a fee or some other type of gateway, causing a distortion in the statistics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors influence the success (or failure) or community. As we saw in my&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html&#34;&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;on community numbers, the first factor is the&amp;#0160;differing&amp;#0160;group thresholds of community sizes. In my&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/11/personal-circle.html&#34;&gt;second article&lt;/a&gt;, I show that&amp;#0160;personal limits on the number of people you can have intimacy and trust with is an important factor. In this article I show that larger groups are subject to the power law of participation inequality, causing a small fraction of a community to be subject to group thresholds. In all three articles I show how expending energy can allow you to change the numbers, but with limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this discussion of community numbers will give you some tools to look at the communities you are in, or are trying to build, and to better understand how to make them more successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;It has been interesting to be part of a local blogging community and how it actually somewhat detracted from my overall bigger online community I was a part of before.  I seemed to have kept only the most dedicated readers (1%) from just simply joining a local group.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Chris - this was a really great series of 3 posts - it is outlined as well as anything I&#39;ve seen on the subject.
In the course of your experience have you seen much of a difference between the style of content produced in communities and how that impacts the power law?  A few years ago I started a project to create an open source methodology for information management http://www.openmethodology.org, which worked in concert with corporate solutions also built in a collaborative fashion.  At least in this case, we have found the power law threshold to be even higher when creating a more structured, method-based approach to collaboration.  We did feel there was a need to put some controls in place for an &#34;open method&#34; and have experimented with different ways to build a collaborative commmunity.  Some good progress has been made, but its been tough going!
We also applied this same approach to sustainability http://www.open-sustainability.org.  Once again, very hard work to build the community but some slow steps are being made.
Do you have any thoughts around more structured collaboration and how it can negatively impact community growth in readership and contributions?  Any recommendations on ways to improve it?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2008 13:53:36 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/circle_of_hands.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2008/09/22/circle_of_hands.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Circle of Hands&#34; alt=&#34;Circle of Hands&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We often think of communities as organic creatures, which come into existence and grow on their own. However, the truth is they are fragile blossoms. Although many communities surely germinate and bloom on their own, purposefully creating communities can take a tremendous amount of hard work, and one factor their success ultimately depends upon is their &lt;em&gt;numbers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a community is too small you&#39;ll often have insufficient critical mass to sustain it. Conversely, if it&#39;s too large you can end up with a community that&#39;s too noisy, too cliquey, or otherwise problematic. These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can analyze these community sizes in three ways. In this first article I&#39;m going to talk about numerical group thresholds that have been observed in various sizes of tightly-knit communities, while in its sequel I&#39;m going to talk about personal thresholds and how they relate to group thresholds. In my final post, I&#39;m going to consider how power laws and inequalities of participation further complicate these simple values in the creation of larger communities. Together these three articles constitute what I call &amp;quot;Community by the Numbers,&amp;quot; a theory of community size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I&#39;m going to point to some studies which support these numbers, in general my goal here isn&#39;t to try and prove this theory of community size numbers, but rather to lay the theory out completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tightly-Knit Group Thresholds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups can clearly exist at any size, from a partnership of two, on upward. However what I&#39;m going to write about here are the threshold values: the ideal numbers where a community seems to function best, and the less than ideal numbers at which a community begins to grow unstable, remaining so until a new threshold number is reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also specifically talking about groups that are both tightly-knit and participatory communities. Clearly Ford Motor Company, with 250,000 employees, doesn&#39;t match any of these group thresholds. But any self-contained community within Ford probably will (and in fact, it will probably be either a &amp;quot;Working Group&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Group&amp;quot;, both terms I&#39;ll explain below). Similarly, a non-corporate community that doesn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; everyone to participate won&#39;t work quite the same as a community that does require participation from each member (though that&#39;s again the topic of the third article in this series).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.singers.com/jazz/group7.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;132&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2008/09/22/group7.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Group7&#34; alt=&#34;Group 7&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7, &amp;quot;The Working Group&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;Working_Group&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This community size probably runs from about 4-9 members, but 7 is a pretty good average, and one that shows up in &lt;a href=&#34;http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/workinggroup&#34;&gt;multiple studies&lt;/a&gt;. This number may well relate to the general &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_seven&#34;&gt;rule of seven&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/&#34;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt;), which suggests that 7 is a number that the brain can easily and intuitively comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become increasingly clear that a tightly-knit group of 7 is the first group size which is truly an optimal community size. Groups below this size can function effectively, but risk not having
enough manpower to deliver a result that everyone is happy with, or having insufficient viewpoints to avoid group think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven is not only an optimal size for a wide variety of corporate and government committees, it is also a healthy size for a small business and even a good size for a party of close friends. More importantly, 7 is a very comfortable group size as it &amp;quot;feels&amp;quot; relatively natural. At this size members find it easy to get to know the other members of the group, and they&#39;re able to function well together in a very intuitive and organic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=560,height=403,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;143&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Squad and Fire Team&#34; title=&#34;Squad and Fire Team&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
An interesting example of this group size is the modern infantry
&amp;quot;squad&amp;quot;, which consists of two fire teams of 4 people, and a squad
leader, for a total of 9 people. Each fire team is is large enough to
function on its own, but together the group of 9 can still have effective
small group dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is typically at this size that the first signs of leadership in a group informally emerge, but the leadership usually isn&#39;t overbearing at this level, nor does there tend to be any rebellion against it — perhaps because the group may be too small to elicit multiple leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;109&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2008/09/22/lastsupper.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Last Supper&#34; alt=&#34;Last Supper&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;Judas_Number&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
13—&amp;quot;The Judas Number&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A group size of 13 doesn&#39;t represent a threshold ideal value, but rather a threshold nadir. It is one of the points where groups can change behavior and risk becoming dysfunctional. There&#39;s one of these nadirs beyond every group threshold, where the previously harmonious group dynamics become more difficult. I&#39;ve chosen to highlight this specific number because it&#39;s a point that small communities often hit, particularly as entrepreneurial organizations try to grow above their startup beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I should note that 13 isn&#39;t a precise number, but rather one offered because it&#39;s in the right range and because it&#39;s poetically easy to remember. The exact number occurs somewhere between 9 and 25, but I suspect it is worst in the range of 12-15.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a group of this community size no one ever feels like they get a fair share of time. Studies show that at this size participants underestimate the amount of time they contributed to the conversation, and thus will come out feeling like they were unfairly ignored despite having a fair share of the conversation. Groups of this size risk people being lumped into categories and ceasing to be trusted as individuals. In addition, problems start with the development of &amp;quot;too many chiefs,&amp;quot; yet there is not enough enough variety of non-chiefs for them to direct. Furthermore, multiple leaders may struggle for hierarchical status, increasing the conflict in an already troublesome group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your community is unfortunately stuck at this nadir, one of two things usually occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, the group shrinks. This could be because participants unhappy with the group dynamics abandon it; or it could occur in a more organized way with the unwieldy large group breaking into two or more smaller groups. For example, a terrible group of 13 could become two more functional groups of 6 and 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, more energy could be expended. This could be in the form of more formal organization, rewards for participation, or more time to be casual and socialize in order to shake off the tensions of this size group. Though these efforts don&#39;t usually change the size of the group, they can improve its dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy could also be spent to help push the group up to the next threshold. Though this could occur naturally — for example if the group focuses on a topic of particular interest that causes new people to continually be added. In addition, in order to grow a group to a new threshold it often requires the efforts of more than one leader to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group size of 13 isn&#39;t necessarily bad, just more difficult. Anthropological studies show that primitive hunting tribes often temporarily broke into &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot; of this size — my presumption is that the value of having that many people hunting together outweighed the social costs of the group. It is interesting that most juries are made up of groups this size. I believe that the social dynamics of this size of group with all new members creates some tension among the jurors, which may serve justice to make sure that all sides are considered by the jury without falling into groupthink. However, from my experience, the interpersonal conflict in a jury can also slow down the deliberation process and cause much frustration among the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png&#34; title=&#34;Non-Exclusive Networks&#34; alt=&#34;Non Exclusive Networks&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
50—&amp;quot;The Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More properly this group size falls in the range of 25-75 participants, but it seems to feel the most natural in the range of 50-60. Studies of the sizes guilds in online games &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html&#34;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; this hypothesis. For instance, based on graphs of the guild sizes in Ultima Online, groups have a median of 61 members. Similar numbers hold true in studies of a more recent game, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this value the &amp;quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&amp;quot; because it matches the lower end of a threshold that &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Robin Dunbar&lt;/a&gt; set for group sizes. However, at this size it applies to mostly non-exclusive groupings, which includes the above mentioned online guilds, many employee communities, and the majority of social gatherings that manage to rise above the size of a Working Group. Groups of this size &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be serious or take up a lot of time, but in general they are not exclusive — they don&#39;t tend to be the only group that individual participants are involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90—&amp;quot;The Dunbar Valley&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; As Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number communities grow, they reach a point where increased time obligations and the noise of socialization required to keep the group cohesive requires a much more serious commitment from the participants. Like the Judas Number, the Dunbar Valley is a threshold nadir where more energy is required to keep a tightly-knit community together;&amp;nbsp; either the community agrees to a higher level of commitment and grows to the next level, or the community splits apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found this to be true when growing a small business — where it is too small for any middle-management, but the sub-groups are too large for one person to manage effectively. I&#39;ve also seen this with more ephemeral groups, such as when a small conference that worked well at 60 participants tries to grow and finds at at 100 participants they can&#39;t sustain a high enough intimacy level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=400,height=290,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;145&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Roman Legion&#34; alt=&#34;Roman Legion&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Another illustration of the Dunbar Valley is the history of the ancient Roman &amp;quot;century&amp;quot;, a grouping that was originally 100 soldiers. However, as the years went by, centuries tended to decrease in numbers to only include 70 or 80 soldiers. This might well be due to Non-Exclusive Dunbar constraints: even in a very devoted group of military men, there was still the need for relationships with other century groups, with support staff, and with camp followers, ultimately lowering the attention that could be spent on the century itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;150—&amp;quot;The Exclusive Dunbar Number&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; Robin Dunbar got much of the discussion of group thresholds started with his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/dunbar93coevolutionOf.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans.&amp;quot; However, as I&#39;ve written &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, and as I&#39;ve described in this article, Dunbar&#39;s group threshold of 150 applies more to groups that are highly incentivized and relatively exclusive and whose goal is survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunbar makes this obvious by the statement that such a grouping &amp;quot;would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The result of the grooming requirement is that communities bounded by the Exclusive Dunbar Number are relatively few. You will find hunter/gatherer and other subsistence societies where this is a natural tribe size. You&#39;ll also find these groups sizes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/03/what_is_the_opt.html&#34;&gt;terrorist and mafia&lt;/a&gt; organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=430,height=279,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;129&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg&#34; title=&#34;The Sopranos at Dinner&#34; alt=&#34;The Sopranos at Dinner&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Clearly, as we step up toward higher group thresholds, more and more
time is required to simply keep the group going. You see this in
depictions of mafia life — in the TV series &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt; a lot of time
is spent dining, hanging out, and drinking together. That is part of that 42% social
grooming time required for that intense of a survival group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible for a large company to force groups up to this size by expending lots of energy (which is to say money) to keep it healthy. Apple did this during the invention of the Macintosh, the first OS X operating system, and the iPhone, but the intensity required of such large teams is not sustainable for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without that extra energy, few modern tightly-knit communities can reach this threshold, or else can&#39;t hold it for very long. Instead they fracture into groups of individual interest (even if they continue to &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; in the same real-world or online forum), which are more than more likely to be bounded by the Non-Exclusive Dunbar number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the difficulty in even arriving at the Exclusive Dunbar number, it may well be the highest limit of all for a tightly-knit community. Beyond this limit, communities are less cohesive, less trusted, and less participatory (and the topic of my third article in this series.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways to measure groups, and one is by counting its members. As I&#39;ve discussed here, the number of members can have a huge impact on whether the communities are successful or not. Thus, as community organizers, social software engineers, game designers, or as sociologists interested in community dynamics, we must ultimately consider group thresholds and group nadirs; to understand how to create cohesive communities, rather than groups that fly apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/11/personal-circle.html&#34;&gt;next article&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m going to talk about thresholds that are personal, rather then group-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;This view of group size dynamics has a lot of potential implications for all kinds of things including management science and more specifically/interesting to me startup dynamics. Namely, you&#39;re proposing an outline that can be mapped to company size and funding levels, amounts of management required/deployable etc. Have you thought of making a stronger connection in this area?

Reading :
&#34;These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.&#34;
Reminds me of Quantum states of Electrons spinning around the nucleus. So, maybe different quantic numbers of persons generate different energy levels, apt for different services?
Also as an analogy, if I recall well, when coming from an external path to an internal one allows the matter to shed light. So, maybe as we internalize we allow light to reach outward?

      <title>BayChi Talk Next Tuesday</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2006/07/baychi_talk_nex.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2006 13:58:20 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2006/07/baychi_talk_nex.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/baychi_1.gif&#34; title=&#34;Baychi_1&#34; alt=&#34;Baychi_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;
I will be speaking next Tuesday (July 11th) at the monthly meeting of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20060711/&#34;&gt;BayCHI&lt;/a&gt;, the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of ACM SIGCHI (Computer Human Interface Special Interest Group), along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goldhaber.org/&#34;&gt;Michael H. Goldhaber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synopsis of my topic is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dunbar Number, Unstructured Trust, and Why Groups Don&#39;t Scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We are relying increasingly on internet-mediated social software tools for our day-to-day interaction with other people. To design this type of software, we must better understand the psychology and social dynamics of individuals in groups. Awareness of what makes us human is now often as important to the success of the software as is understanding software architecture and code. One particular sociological factor, the Dunbar Number, is useful in understanding why groups don&#39;t scale at different group sizes. A deeper awareness of why groups have different behaviors, the nature
of unstructured trust, and which current tools appear to work best at different scales, can give guidance to both the online facilitator and the social software designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael H. Goldhaber will be speaking on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parc.com/about/directions.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Maptoparc&#34; title=&#34;Maptoparc&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/maptoparc.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Nature of the Emerging Attention Economy: Seen As a New Level in the Massively Multiplayer Game Known as Western Culture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Think of the human world as a Massively Multiple Interactive Game (which it is). As interactions change and increase, we are passing to a new level, something that hasn’t really happened to the same depth for centuries. The rules, fundamental values, and just about everything else are diverging from what was familiar in the level characterized by the exchange of Money, the prevalence of Markets and the dominance of Industrial production of standardized goods (call this MMI). The new level also depends on human abilities and desires, but now what matters most is our strictly limited abilities to pay attention and our much greater (on average) desires to receive it. The full passage will take many decades, but we are already well along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location is at PARC&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baychi.org/program/directions/&#34;&gt;George E. Pake Auditorium&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto, and the talk starts at 7:30. There also an optional &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20060711/dinner/&#34;&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt; beforehand &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.californiacafe.com/palo_alto.php&#34;&gt;nearby&lt;/a&gt; at 5:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see some of you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dunbar Number &amp; Group Cohesion</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2005 16:16:17 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is some more excellent research this week by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickyee.com/&#34;&gt;Nick Yee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parc.com/nicolas&#34;&gt;Nicolas Ducheneaut&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/&#34;&gt;PlayOn&lt;/a&gt; blog. Again, their research provides good insight into social group dynamics as they appear in online games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I last mentioned their research on guild sizes in my blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar &amp;amp; World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; where I compare the distribution of guild sizes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uo.com/&#34;&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/a&gt; vs PlayOn&amp;#39;s results from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. However, both distribution tables suffer from a variety of biases due to the nature of the different game designs, many of which are discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html#comments&#34;&gt;commments in the post&lt;/a&gt;. For instance both guild graphs include &amp;quot;alts&amp;quot;, which are alternative characters of individual players. Thus one player might be represented multiple times in a guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nic &amp;amp; Nick&amp;#39;s more recent research, they are looking deeper and are &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html&#34;&gt;mapping social networks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090425222428/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; on World of Warcraft. Using tools available to them, over the course of the month of August they looked at 241,378 characters and 5569 guilds. From that data they were able to able to discover how often guild members were co-present (online at the same time) or co-located (online and in the same zone in the game)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;G-3&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-500wi&#34; title=&#34;G-3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in this map you can see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...we have a guild where we see more distinct cliques. There&amp;#39;s a somewhat hard-core 4 character cluster on the left- hand side, a mid-level triad on the bottom left, a mid 20&amp;#39;s clique that&amp;#39;s held together by the druid in the middle, and finally a more casual low-level clique on the top right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this same data, they then looked at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;max subgraph size of guilds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. A &amp;quot;subgraph&amp;quot; in a social network can be thought of as a &amp;quot;clique&amp;quot; of people that interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image005&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image005&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the social network of this guild there are 5 subgraphs, 4 of which are just 2 people and 1 subgraph that is of 6. The 4 subgraphs that are only of 2 people are members of the guild who did not participate much in the guild. But the number of people in the subgraph of 6 is much more interesting, as it shows that these members are &amp;quot;cohesive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the max subgraph size of a guild is plotted against the guild size, you get some interesting results -- the maximum guild cohesiveness occurs around the guild size of 50. Larger then that, guilds have a much more difficult time remaining cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image011&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image011&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results strong support my hypothesis in my original &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; post, where I...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&amp;#39;t have requisite variety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some possible other support for this hypothesis comes from another post by Nic &amp;amp; Nick where they analyze the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html&#34;&gt;time guilds spend together&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;(now 404, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20081119142033/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image004&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image004&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the mean amount of time that guilds spend together in the band 31 - 60 is only 95 minutes and that the standard deviation is the lowest, as compared to groups that are larger then 120 where the mean time is 141 minutes at the standard deviation is higher. This says to me that keeping a large group cohesive requires significantly more time in social &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my original &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; post I had a secondary hypothesis where I talk about peak in satisfaction in smaller groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of &amp;quot;team&amp;quot; really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough &amp;quot;attention&amp;quot; is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is strong support for this in another plot found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;max subgraph size of guilds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20081231143011/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; post where they compare the subgraph ration to guild sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image013&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image013&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see a strong peak at 10 people, that rapidly falls with guild size. This shows that guild cohesion is relatively easy to maintain up to size 10, but becomes much more difficult to maintain as guilds grow larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been saying for some time that studying online games is a valuable place to understanding social software. I&amp;#39;m quite pleased that this research is proving this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not sure that with standard deviations so high on the &#34;Time spent together by guild size&#34; that you can draw super strong conclusions about differences been group cohesiveness by group.  One or two extra-connected group is going to throw off your numbers quite a bit.  If you have the data and can scatterplot them instead of showing averages I suspect you&#39;ll be able to make a case more clear.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;The military, and educational institutions, have discovered similar thresholds for collectivities. I think the number of friends any of us can sustain, in any manner (on, offline) is around 200. And that&#39;s pushing it. Magic numbers in small business are 12 and approx 30-35, I believe. Intersting that it might hold for online as well as offline.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Great series on Dunbar limit. One minor nitpick - I think your first PlayOn image link might be wrong. I thing the text you&#39;ve quoted refers to their bottom-left image which is g-3 rather than g-4 (the 4-character cluster is *really* obvious in g-3).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my initial blog entry on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; I presented some statistics on group sizes based on the online game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uo.com&#34;&gt;Ultimata Online&lt;/a&gt;. In it you could clearly see the power-law (pareto) curve, with diminishing returns at around 150, with most groups being 60 in size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html#onlinecommunities&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;550&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/UOGuildPowerLaw.jpg&#34; width=&#34;814&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html#onlinecommunities&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;536&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/UOGuildHistogram.jpg&#34; width=&#34;829&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickyee.com/&#34;&gt;Nick Yee&lt;/a&gt; and other researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/&#34;&gt;PlayOn Blog&lt;/a&gt; have been researching the behaviors of players in the popular &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; online game. At my request, they sampled guild sizes over a one-week period, and prepared &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html&#34;&gt;similar graphs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060205115408/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html&#34;&gt;internet archive link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(&amp;#39;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/graphs/guildsize.html&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;popup&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;width=925,height=348,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&amp;#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Guildsize&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b image-full img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294004970b-800wi&#34; title=&#34;Guildsize&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Guildsizehisto&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b image-full img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c8294012970b-800wi&#34; title=&#34;Guildsizehisto&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these statistics still support my original hypothesis in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; post that mean group sizes will be smaller than 150 for non-survival oriented groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&amp;#39;t have requisite variety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the diminishing returns for large groups in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; appear to cut off much sooner then they do in &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt;, with the 95th percentile 54 and the 99th percentile being 110. When I asked about why the &amp;#39;knee&amp;#39; was much closer to 50 rather than &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;knee around 150, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.legendmud.org/raph/&#34;&gt;Raph Koster&lt;/a&gt; (the game designer who gave me the original &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; data) answered that it might be because &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; used a &amp;quot;veteran member&amp;quot; method of counting. This could result in under reporting of new users and thus pushing up sizes of more established groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also different was the fact that the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; guild sizes display a reverse power-law, with the smallest groups being much more common, rather then the bell curve of &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt;. If one-person guilds are excluded, the average guild size was 16.8, the median was 9. This seems to correspond much closer to my thoughts on a smaller &amp;#39;nodal&amp;#39; threshold for group size that I&amp;#39;ve observed at around 15, which I describe in &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that there is something about &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; such that even participating in very small groups can be useful, whereas for &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; the utility is gained mainly by sharing the resources earned by larger groups. Thus &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; has groups that are &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot;, while with &lt;em&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/em&gt; groups are more llikely to be just &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve not had time to play &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; yet, so I&amp;#39;m curious if those who have more experience would agree with my hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I play WoW on a regular basis, and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by the preponderance of small guilds, as the best high-end gear is available in instances that require raids involving large groups of high-level players (up to 40 people). In fact, this is an oft repeated complaint on the WoW forums: smaller guilds do not have access to this gear unless they can manage to form alliances with other small guilds.
However, for low and mid-level players, going through instances only requires 5-player groups, and instances are usually the best source for great gear at every level, so for those players who haven&#39;t reached level 60 yet, there is no immediate advantage to joining a large guild.
I would therefore be curious to see a correlation between player level and guild size.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I play WoW and I&#39;ve never played UO but I&#39;ve heard from many MMORPG veterans that WoW is far too kind in terms of its penalities for death. In fact, there&#39;s little penalty for death besides 10% damage to your equipment (easily repairable) and walking your spirit back your corpse. In other games, things like gold, items, rank and experience can be lost as a result of character death.
This could mean that there&#39;s simply less of a survival mentality amoungst players and groups are formed for rewards rather than for aversion of penalties.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I don&#39;t know about UO, but WoW features individualised gear. Certain gear, once &#34;owned,&#34; simply cannot be passed on to someone else. As such, in the earlier levels, it&#39;s possible that players not even bother to join a guild. It&#39;s entirely viable to solo up until the high level instances. There isn&#39;t as much dependence on grouping.
My opinion, of course. YMMV.

Some facts about WoW guild sizes:
What is the point of a guild with one member? Since the guild name is displayed with your character, then it is like a last name for your character ( a further way to show how clever you are) even a guild of one can have it&#39;s own guild tabard
Guild of less then 5: You can only have 2 professions so it is worthwhile to team up with others that you can trade goods with tailoring/enchanting mining/blacksmithing skinning/leather-working there is also mining/engineering but almost none of the stuff engineers make can be shared so for lower level character a group of 3 can be VERY helpful, also 3 is an easy to maintain group size and obviously the killing/questing goes much faster. This group falls apart for characters higher then 30 (for reason listed below)
Guilds of around 5+: Most instance dungeons must be done with 5 players, each with a role (tank, healer, damage, off-tank, off-healer), a 3 player guild will need 2 pick-up players.  Pick-up players, as a rule, are used to playing solo and don&#39;t stay in a role as well, leading to lots of problems.
Guilds of around 40+: High lvl dungeons need 40 players, so I think your results would look extremely different if you only showed lvl 50 or higher characters also blacksmithing splits into 2 specialties and leather-working splits into 3 specialties leading to larger group size.
Another thing that affects group size is &#34;alts&#34;, if I create a killer guild, I am going to want all my characters to belong to it, even if I don&#39;t play them anymore.  So by looking a just lvl50 or higher characters I think you would strip out a lot of &#34;alts&#34;, and that would give a better &#34;real&#34; group size
&lt;/p&gt;

WoW has taken a lot of steps to enable players to find players to group with, such as dedicated chat channels and a system allowing players to join a queue and be automatically placed in groups.  Also WoW is incredibly solo-friendly - you never need to group to get to level 60, and even some endgame content is accessible such as the PvP Battlegrounds.  The points already mentioned about the simple tradeskill structure and absence of tradeable &#39;hand-me-downs&#39; are crucial as well, so I&#39;m not too surprised you see a smaller average guild size.
If WoW incorporated a working formal alliance structure you might see it splinter even more.
On a more general note, if a guild is being formed for 40-person raids, only the hardest of the hardcore will actually have 40 players - they&#39;d want sufficient numbers to be able to routinely get 40 players of appropriate level and class distribution together.
My WoW guild has reached sizes where 40-person groups are sometimes possible spontaneously.  In my opinion we&#39;re skirting, and probably have crossed into, the &#39;too-large&#39; realm.  I find I&#39;m more likely to ignore guild chat, simply because there are so many people and things going on.  I also don&#39;t feel as close to guildmates - to the point of not recognizing some - which has never happened to me before.
I blame the game.  WoW owes much of it&#39;s success to being more casual friendly, and has a tendency to attract and even promote less social playstyles.  I notice my behavior is changed from past MMO&#39;s when I was perfectly happy to just chat for awhile.  In WoW everything is go, less (or no) downtime between fights, more interaction needed during battles (I most often play a rogue, which plays more like a FPS than anything else), less travel time, it all adds up to a game which is very fun, yes, but definatley less social.
P.S.  Anyone studied the effects of Teamspeak on optimal group/raid/guild sizes?

World of Warcraft is actually quite intricate in its workings. The style of play often changes with the level of the player&#39;s character(s). Also, the ruleset a person is playing on influences how they group and interact with people.
For instance, on the PvP servers, now that the majority of players have had high level characters for a while, practically no one does low-level instances. People are either busy in battlegrounds (BG&#39;s) or high level instances. So most people who aren&#39;t level 60 end up soloing or grouping with very few people. But a guild is ideal to have, as you can call people in for backup when enemy players are ganking you while levelling up. But this makes the size of these guilds rather arbitrary.
When a person reaches level 60 on the PvP servers, they tend to join a guild that participates in PvP fairly often. It doesn&#39;t require many people to PvP, as some BG&#39;s only allow 10 people. And those BG&#39;s that allow more are difficult to get into, so people only enter in small groups anyway. Even for the small BG&#39;s it can be difficult to enter the server with a predetermined group, due to the way the queueing system works. So the desire for small groups on PvP servers is high (as it is easier to enter the BG&#39;s). This can make some guilds fairly small.
It should be noted about the PvE ruleset that a lot of low-level players are able to participate in low-end 5-to-10-man dungeons (almost always done with 5), as the interest in fairly high amongst those levelling up alts and new players. So people new to this low-level content often join small guilds, or guilds with a vast number of low-level alts.
Now, when people participate in high-level dungeons, things are a little different. Really, there is only one high-level dungeon that is for five people. And there are a few high-level dungeons that allow for 10 or 15 people, but neither they nor the 5-man dungeon offer the best loot. This causes only casual players to really concentrate on that content.
Sometimes, a player will want to approach the game in a serious, hardcore manner, but because they can&#39;t handle large groups or are generally anti-social, they may end up staying in a smaller guild. I&#39;ve encountered three cases of this, all of which involved personal online gaming friends.
In terms of hardcore, high-level content, you have three 40-man dungeons (however, I&#39;d classify one of them as a simple encounter), one 20-man dungeon and two outdoor, 40-man encounters that offer the best loot. With the addition of the 20-man raid dungeon, I expect average guild sizes will fall slightly. But I&#39;m sure there will be plenty of guilds concentrating on the 40-man PvE content.
In order to do the complex 40-man raid dungeons, you need a guild that has at least 40 people that can play regularly, the right class setup, and backups to take the place of crucial missing pieces. However, I have often found that there are &#34;regulars&#34; that show up to almost every raid. This means the number of backups is usually relatively small.
This explanation is not very eloquent, I realize, but I hope it brings some insight into things. It&#39;s rather a subjective opinion, as well. I don&#39;t have numbers to back this up--it&#39;s all based on personal experience with both rulesets.
&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your open question as to whether World of Warcraft had some characteristics that caused it to trend towards lower guild sizes.
I&#39;ve been playing World of Warcraft since release. In short, your answer is &#34;yes&#34;.
Compared to other MMOs, World of Warcraft is different in significant respects. The level grind to cap (60) is -much- less intense than in comparable games. I believe that the average time to 60 in terms of days played is about 15 days and it can be much less for a veteran player.
WoW is very quest-oriented and a majority of quests are accomplishable solo. Quests usually fall into the typical categories of kill-quests, loot-quests, and Fedexes. If you want to level quickly, you do this by solo grinding and cherry-picking quests.
On the path to 60, WoW offers several instanced raid dungeons. On the alliance side, there&#39;s Deadmines, Stockades, Shadowfang Keep, Uldaman, Scarlet Monastery, Zul&#39;Farrak, Maraudon, Sunken Temple. These instances have some quests in them, but, in addition, they&#39;re participant-capped. No more than 5 grouped players can be in the instance parts of these dungeons.
This has the effect of allowing guilds with less than 5 regular people to successfully reach level cap as a social group.
Once a player reaches 60, however, things start to change. 60th level players very quickly exhaust the number of quests that are available to them. This leaves only the high-end instances to do:
Blackrock Depths
Stratholme
Scholomance
Blackrock Spire
Zul&#39;Gurub
Molten Core
The maximum number of players who can participate on these endgame instances increases dramatically. Blackrock Depths is limited to 5 participants. Strat and Scholo are 10, I think. Blackrock Spire is 15. Molten Core is 40. Zul&#39;Gurub is a new &#34;starter&#34; raid instance that requires 20.
Small guilds who make it to 60 often find that they are &#39;stranded&#39;, without enough critical mass to perform the higher level raid instances but without the connections to join with other guilds to participate in them. This abrupt transition of the gameplay at the end from casual to hardcore is a common player complaint.
Another factor that may lead to smaller guild sizes in the endgame compared to Ultima Online is that practically all raid content IS instanced. This means that to get the best loot, a guild needs to be able to muster only the raid-limit cap for that particular instance. In contrast, in Ultima Online, my understanding is that many of the end-game bosses are out &#39;in the open&#39; and on long spawns. This means that to achieve success, guilds in that game not only need to be able to muster enough players to defeat the raid encounter but must ALSO achieve enough mass in order to prevent other guilds from dominating the spawn. This becomes a sheer numbers game.
&lt;/p&gt;

While I have not played WOW, in EVE-online another MMPOG, the occurence of corporations smaller than 3 is usually because the members are subverting the rules.
samll corps exist so that people can play solo, outside of the normal social infrastructure. In dangerous areas the new player corps are normally Kill On Site, so experienced solo players create a corp for the small number of characters that individual person operates.
small corps exist so that you can declare war and blackmail other corps without your main corp suffering any fallback.
Or they serve as peoples murderous &#39;alt&#39; characters, again so that you can avoid any come back onto your main character or corp.
small corps exist so that they can create clones without needing to build high standing of your main corp (a sort of game exploit).
small corps exist to scam money out of people by creating fake lotteries etc
small corps exist so that an alt character can run a business away from the normal agreed rules of the corp that the main character is part of.
If similar things happen in other MMPOGs, it might be worth ignoring the small groups when drawing conclusions about social groups, they usually exist to either be explicitly anti-social or to subvert the game mechanics in some way.

      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/07/cheers_belongin.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2&#34;&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/a&gt;, NPR commentator &lt;a href=&#34;http://jakehalpern.com/news.html&#34;&gt;Jake Halpern&lt;/a&gt; questions why you feel like you have a relationship with the characters in your favorite TV shows. His answer: &amp;quot;That&#39;s because you do.&amp;quot; This idea is interesting not just to help us understand how we relate to imaginary characters, but also to correlate with our own understanding of &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; relationship limits and how they might relate to this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4772145&#34;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt;, Bostonian Jake Halpern considers two academic ideas, &amp;quot;belongingness theory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;para-social relationships&amp;quot;, and how they affect the relationships we develop with television characters. He puts it all in the context of the 1990s TV show &lt;em&gt;Cheers&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/cheers.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Cheers&#34; alt=&#34;Cheers&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&amp;quot;My preoccupation with &lt;/em&gt;Cheers the Bar&lt;em&gt; puzzled me until I stumbled upon a rather obscure but quite fascinating academic notion called &lt;/em&gt;belongingness theory&lt;em&gt;.The argument goes something like this: in ancient times humans who stuck together increased the chances that they would survive and reproduce. So, when it came time to, say, hunt a large animal, or defend the cave against marauders, groups fared better then the guy on his own. In addition, adults in the group would have been more likely to find mates, reproduce, and raise their children. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The likely result of all this evolutionary selection is the creation of an internal mechanism that makes human beings crave social acceptance. The way I figured it, my irrational fondness for &lt;/em&gt;Cheers the Bar&lt;em&gt; was just my belongingness mechanism kicking. I just wanted to be part of the gang.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belongingness theory seems to have a good scientific basis. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/baumeist.dp.html&#34;&gt;Baumeister&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Leary&#39;s 1995 paper on Belongingness Theory, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=PubMed&amp;amp;a mp;list_uids=7777651&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract&#34;&gt;The Need to Belong&lt;/a&gt;, they stated that in order for belongingness to be considered a fundamental human motivation (as opposed to a want), it would have to be universal, affect a broad range of behaviors, lead to ill effects when thwarted, and elicit goal-oriented behavior designed to satisfy it. They found evidence for all of these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&#39;m quite comfortable with the idea that evolution has encouraged us to have a number of &amp;quot;social emotions&amp;quot;, and that these may include a strong desire to belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halpern continues in his commentary with a discussion of &lt;em&gt;para-social relationships&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;And this brings to yet another academic theory, that of &lt;/em&gt;para-social relationships&lt;em&gt;. According to academics Horton and Wohl, who originated this concept, television gives viewers the &amp;quot;illusion of a face-to-face relationship with the performer&amp;quot;. Gradually over the course of many episodes, viewers come to feel that they &#39;&lt;/em&gt;know&lt;em&gt;&#39; a persona.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I totally buy it. After watching dozens of Cheers episodes, I felt as if I knew the personas in the show intimately. In fact there were times when I had seen more of the characters on Cheers then I seen of the people in my own family. So, yeah, I definitely had some para-social relationships going on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The truth is, we all yearn for companionship. The only problem is, that for many of us, myself included, the notion of a well-functioning family and a welcoming group of friends and co-workers, is occasionally more easily found on television or in the movies, than in life itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After all, in order to maintain &lt;/em&gt;&#39;real&#39;&lt;em&gt; relationships, you have to put in a tremendous amount of effort: making phone calls; returning emails; planning weekends together; etc. To maintain para-social relationships, however, all you have to do is flick on the TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I&#39;m being honest with myself, I have to admit that at times, Norm, Cliff, Carla, and Sam have formed, well, a kind of para-family to which I yearn to belong. I suppose that hideously hackneyed as it sounds, it&#39;s just like the show&#39;s theme song goes: &lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they&#39;re always glad you came.&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt; Only, they &lt;strong&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; know your name, and they really don&#39;t know you came.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake&#39;s description of Horton &amp;amp; Wohl&#39;s theory on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Modules/TF33120/horton_and_wohl_1956.html&#34;&gt;para-social relationships&lt;/a&gt; definitely parallels my thoughts in a previous post &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Triage: Too Many Connections&lt;/a&gt; where I ask &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; As Jake said, it&#39;s difficult because you have to make the effort: the phone calls, the emails, meeting in person, and all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the concept of having real relationships with television characters might give us enlightenment into some other relationship issues. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the mismatch between my number of connections and my own limits due to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt;; intuitively I feel that limiting my television watching can help. This is because these TV relationships are what I call &amp;quot;junk relationships&amp;quot;. Sometimes when I talk about the concept of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt;, I said that we may have difficulty even reaching the Dunbar limit of 150 people because of the &amp;quot;junk relationships&amp;quot; we maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does every ongoing para-social relationship with an ongoing series character, such as Cliff on Cheers or Kate on Lost, lower the number of relationships we can have with real people? I believe that this may be so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if so, the answer to maintaining more connections with real people may be simply to turn off the television and tune in the real world instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2005 11:38:19 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my post about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; I offered some evidence on the levels of satisfaction of various group sizes based on some empirical data from online games. There I was able to show that even though the Dunbar Number might predict a mean group size of 150 for humans, that in fact for non-survival oriented groups the mean was significantly less, probably between 60 to 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/groupsatisfaction.gif&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=436,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;272&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Groupsatisfaction&#34; title=&#34;Groupsatisfaction&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/groupsatisfaction.gif&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I also offered a second hypothesis, that there is a dip in satisfaction level of groups at around the size of 15. Unfortunately, I could only offer anecdotal evidence that this threshold existed. My personal belief was that this dip was caused by not enough &amp;quot;attention&amp;quot; being given to everyone and that group gatherings of this size risk becoming too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Yet groups of this size are not large enough to allow for different perspectives (i.e. insufficient &lt;a href=&#34;http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REQVAR.html&#34;&gt;requisite variety&lt;/a&gt;) or for other group processes to come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading through the current (12 March) issue of &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;, and found an interesting table in the article &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18524901.600&#34;&gt;Charity Begins at Homo Sapiens&lt;/a&gt;. It stood out to me as it showed a dip approaching zero average cooperation for group sizes of 16 -- almost precisely same place that my hypothesis predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging further, I found the original source for this table was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; back in October 2003, in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/papers/NatureOfHumanAltruism.pdf&#34;&gt;The Nature of Human Altruism&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/&#34;&gt;Ernst Fehr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fischbacher/&#34;&gt;Urs Fischbacher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=495,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;309&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/images/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif&#34; title=&#34;Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1&#34; alt=&#34;Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: left;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What the chart shows is actually not empirical data from human experiments, but instead data from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory&#34;&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt; simulation of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&#34;&gt;prisoner&#39;s dilemma&lt;/a&gt;. This is the classic &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum&#34;&gt;zero-sum game&lt;/a&gt; where if you cooperate, the joint payoff of the players is higher. However, in zero-sum games there is also incentive for the players to cheat by defecting and thus taking less risk. Robert Axelrod showed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465021212/102-0974708-1794504&#34;&gt;The Evolution of Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; back in 1985 that in spite of the statistical best individual strategy being that of defection, cooperation inevitably evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fehr and Fischbacher, in their &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article, took this idea a bit further by creating 100 independent simulations with group sizes ranging from 2 to 512, and then executing each simulation 1,000 to 2,000 times. Each generation of the &amp;quot;players&amp;quot; was allowed to evolve different strategies of cooperation vs defection, the classic successful strategy being &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat&#34;&gt;Tit for Tat&lt;/a&gt;. They would then evaluate the percentage of players who had cooperative strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If punishment of defections was ruled out, they discovered that over the 1,000+ generations of the simulation that the rate of cooperation quickly crashes, such that at the group size of 8 a little over 50% cooperation evolved, and for groups that are larger than 16 none cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next they added to the simulation &amp;quot;&lt;a name=&#34;altruistic_punishment&#34;&gt;Altruistic Punishment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. This is the ability for players to punish those who did not cooperate -- however, such punishment is at some cost to the punisher. Earlier game theory &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/get_doc.pl?urn=RePEc:wpa:wuwpmi:0305006&amp;amp;url=http://econwpa.wustl.edu:8089/eps/mic/papers/0305/0305006.pdf&#34;&gt;research on altruistic punishment&lt;/a&gt; has shown that cooperation flourishes if there is some price for punishing defectors -- if you allow punishment at no cost then cheating strategies emerge. This earlier research determined that allowing individuals to punish at some cost that yields them no material gain will paradoxically result in an average gain for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding altruistic punishment to the simulation increased the amount of cooperation that evolved, such that groups with the size of 32 would have 50% cooperation. But even this had limits; at the group size of 128 no cooperation would evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if they added to the simulation the ability to punish those who did not participate in punishing (i.e. didn&#39;t pay the cost to punish defectors), then the percentage of cooperation that evolved was never less then 60%, and in fact got better as groups got larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting result. To explain it in different terms, if you have a system that depends on sharing some &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&#34;&gt;commons&lt;/a&gt; and there are no process or trust metrics, a group as small as 16 may find themselves not cooperating very effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of commons can be as simple as how much speaking time participants in a meeting share. The time that each participant uses during the meeting can be considered the shared &amp;quot;commons&amp;quot;. If there are no enforced rules, with a group size of 16 there will inevitably be someone who will abuse the time and speak more than their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some simple rules (some type of process to partition time more fairly), or through some trust metrics (punish those who abuse the commons), larger groups can gain value from cooperating, but even these groups have limits. As long as there is some effort required to punish those who abuse the process, eventually the price for that effort becomes too high, and no one is willing to punish any longer. You see this in moderated discussion groups, where the guardians of the common good have to spend too much time moderating, given the number of people that wish to participate. Moderated newsgroups and early versions of SlashDot moderation had this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting observation from this simulation is that for larger groups, you needed to have a system to punish those who did not participate in punishing -- or to put it another way, get everyone involved with the process, not just a few. I think that this explains something that I&#39;ve always wondered about SlashDot&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MetaModeration&#34;&gt;meta-moderation&lt;/a&gt; system -- with this feature you grade those who have moderated, and if someone abuses it they will no longer be able to moderate. What I suspect, given these results, is that if you don&#39;t participate in the meta-moderation system, you have less a chance of being able to moderate; thus SlashDot has a system that punishes those who are not involved in participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have some questions based on this simulation -- I would like to see results with more granularity then powers of 2. I&#39;d also like to know the percentage of players participating in punishment -- I suspect that you&#39;ll find a very small number of &amp;quot;moderators&amp;quot; are required in the middle graph, even when cooperation evolves successfully. I&#39;m curious as to how many moderators are required to participate in punishing the non-punishers for cooperation to evolve in the third scenario. Also, in meta-moderation this simulation emphasizes punishing the non-punishers -- is that as successful as rewarding the punishers? I&#39;m also interested in investigating some of the further works where Fehr and Fischbacher are among the co-authors, such as this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/science/Altruistic_Punishment.pdf&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) that shows that our brain&#39;s pleasure systems are activated when we altruistically punish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure that the findings of this simulation are not the only reason why there might be a dip in group satisfaction at group sizes around 15, such as I observed. However, it does offer some interesting insights into group size thresholds, both for the threshold at 15 and for threshold of non-survival groups which I&#39;ve identified as being significantly less then the Dunbar mean of 150. It also shows that for large groups we need to offer not only moderation, but meta-moderation capabilities that involve all the participants in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary this research offers me another widget for my social software toolbox: in any group process look for the commons, allow participants to participate in identifing defectors; determine what the costs are for such identification (which may be as simple as requiring some attention or charging for such punishment); and encourage participation in the common good by punishing those who do not participate in seeking out defectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;You may be onto something. The Dunbar number was referred to in the Tipping Point and in some places plays a role in tribal-forming. But for smaller activities the number 15 seems ideal, eg, for a classroom or workshop. If there&#39;s under 10 or 12, regardless of the room size people want to bail out because there doesn&#39;t seem to be &#34;enough&#34; people. Much over 15 and the group dynamic must change to lecture style as if there were 50 or 100 people.

A superb blog Chris, but just a few errata on the post.
First the simulation in Fehr,et al is a multi-person prisoner&#39;s dilemma--a public goods game--which is identical to the game in the &#34;research on altruistic punishment&#34; link which I think is a great introduction to the literature.
Second, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma is not a zero-sum game although often times mis-attributed as such. In zero-sum games, the total payoff in each possible outcome must be the same; thus, your gain must be my loss. The tragedy of the prisoner&#39;s dilemma is simply that cooperate is not a good strategy for either player.
Third, I think the sentence with the &#34;research on altruistic punishment&#34; link should be &#34;... cooperation flourishes EVEN if there is a cost to punishing defectors.&#34; The later part of the sentence is incorrect. However, the result is still paradoxical as under the notion of rationality one would not expect anyone to incur the cost of punishing another without any personal profit.
Finally, although this research seems to be one capable of addressing organizational size, it is actually quite incapable of that feat. The number 16 on the graph is really a coincidence of circumstances see the graph in http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/SecondOrderFreeRidePublished.pdf for the impact of parameter values on the model. Actually, coincidence is not quite correct; it was a deliberate selection by the researchers. This literature is designed to unshackle economics from the rational agent paradigm not to address optimal organizational size.
I will try to see if there are more pertinent experimental research addressing the Dunbar number question and post them, but I&#39;m somewhat doubtful as the experimental design is still too limited to study such a complex phenomenon. I had thought to try to run such an experiment myself a year ago, but abandoned the idea. I think an econometric analysis of the online games data is probably the most promising course.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;is the supposed cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable social relationships: the kind of relationships that go with knowing who each person is and how each person relates socially to every other person. Proponents assert that group sizes larger than this generally require more restricted rules, laws, and enforced policies and regulations to maintain a stable cohesion.

&lt;p&gt;As someone who now has over 171 professional &amp;quot;connections&amp;quot; in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;amp;key=62844&#34;&gt;LinkedIn Profile&lt;/a&gt;, 198 &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519&#34;&gt;Orkut&lt;/a&gt;, many more non-intersecting friends and acquaintances on&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af&#34;&gt;Tribe.Net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livejournal.com/users/christophera_/&#34;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/sns-meta-list/&#34;&gt;other social networking services&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a plethora of correspondents that I only interact with via email, I am trying reconcile a mismatch between my connections and my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture Capitalist &lt;a href=&#34;http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/02/quality_or_quan.html&#34;&gt;Jeff Nolan&lt;/a&gt; relates similar concerns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&amp;quot;It strikes me that the social networking theory holds that the more volume you have, the bigger your network will become by introducing degrees of separation roughly along the lines of Metcalfe&#39;s Law. I disagree, human networks do not grow in value by multiplying, but rather by reduction. For me, it&#39;s the quality of relationships that enhances my professional and personal life, not the sheer numbers.&amp;quot;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately social networking services -- be it LinkedIn, Tribe.Net, Orkut, or LiveJournal -- are making the problem worse, not solving it. Any engineer or information theorist can tell you that a system that only has amplifiers will be out of balance, and that you need attenuators in the system as well. Our current breed of social networking services have focused on amplifying our contacts not only because it serves us, but because it serves them. The more contacts that you make, the more people they potentially have in their service. However, in the long run this is unsustainable -- a social networking service also has to be useful -- merely amplifying your contacts isn&#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the problem becomes not just one unique to me, where my friends network is overextended, but rather one that&#39;s endemic to the current generation of social networking services. In order to solve it we need to look at the traditional cultural answers to the problem, compare them to technical solutions, both current and to-be-invented, and then see how a new generation of social networking services can be designed that molds the two ideas together into a more cohesive whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offer here the beginning of that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Cultural Strategies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of overextended social networks are not new with the Internet generation. Many professions require maintaining a large base of relationships and have done so for hundreds of years, among them: politicians, salespeople, public company CEOs, and even professions that you might not think of requiring these skills such as family doctors. The Dunbar Number of 150 may be a kind of species-wide average limit, it is not an individual limit -- thus my guess is that people with an innate talent for maintaining more relationships are attracted to these professions. But even with innate talent those who follow these professions can be overwhelmed, and each have found different cultural strategies for managing larger numbers of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Strategy - Spending More Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people just spend a lot more time keeping up with their connections. Politicians and salespeople are classic examples of professions that require significant schmoozing time in order to keep trusted connections together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does someone like a member of the US House of Representatives manage their relationships? In no way can they even come close to having a relationship with all the 645,952 people they represent. They would, however, at least have to keep up at some level with the other 435 House members, their own staff, key members of the staff of other House members, as well as key politicians and contacts back home. From what I&#39;ve read, successful politicians spend most of their days just meeting with people, and have staff dedicated to &amp;quot;tickling&amp;quot; -- keeping track of constituents, schedules, issues, etc. and reminding the politician before each meeting of the essentials they need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of this strategy is twofold -- the time spent managing relationships can&#39;t be spent elsewhere, and the quantity of relationships lowers the quality of those relationships. For instance, my experience with most politicians and many salesperson is that I will be forgotten as soon as I leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Strategy - Changing the Standard:&lt;/strong&gt; There are different cultural standards in each profession as to what is an acceptable relationship. Thus some people chooose a profession that manages relationships in different ways. Doctors are a good example of socializers who fit into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your family doctor has a similar problem to that of politicians -- too many people to keep track of. Yet a good family practitioner can see you and look beyond just today&#39;s symptoms. Thus because of an ongoing relationship with you he can be a better doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the doctor does this is through cultural and professional limits. Because of the authority, status and title granted to doctors, patients tend to defer to them. There is not an expectation that the relationship is equal. This allows the doctor to have a &#39;shallower&#39; relationship with the patient that is still acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even this level of serial, shallow socialization can be excessive for many people. A Radiologist acquaintance of mine told me the reason why she ended up in her specialty was that she just couldn&#39;t handle the ongoing patient relationships required by other specialities -- instead, she now looks at one set of images at a time, performs a diagnosis, and doesn&#39;t have to retain any relationship to move on to the next patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also problems with changing your socialization standards. Unless it is culturally understood, or your standard is reciprocated by others, it can make you appear shallow and not trustworthy. I&#39;ve seen this when someone moves from one profession to another, say a salesperson to a manager -- styles of relationships that were acceptable among salesperson and between salespeople and customers are not quite as acceptable as those between managers and their staff. Another example is when someone moves from the East Coast to the West Coast, where the usefulness of casual alumni connections is significantly less valued, but those casual connections are unable to understand the change in standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Strategy - Prioritization:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps a more common cultural strategy for managing excessive relationships is prioritization. I could prioritize my relationships and focus only on the 100+ or so that might be the most useful to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with prioritizing. First, analyses of social networks show that it is often the weak and most unrelated links that can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1333462/0&#34;&gt;the most important&lt;/a&gt;. Thus any attempt to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage&#34;&gt;triage&lt;/a&gt; may cut off some of these weak ties because I thought that the links might not be &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, how do you tell someone &amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m overly Dunbarred, so I have removed you from my list.&amp;quot; Rejection is painful (as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/mripain01.htm&#34;&gt;MRI brain studies&lt;/a&gt; have actually shown), so I risk offending people forever by excluding them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Technological Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great hopes of social networking services is to improve the ways that we interact with other people, particularly those that we know at a distance -- the &amp;quot;weak links&amp;quot;. Right now, these services are part of the problem because they offer out-of-balance social systems. However, they can also be part of the solution; science-fiction writers and social software designers alike are starting to look at these issues and offer new solutions that would not have been possible before the advent of widespread software communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Solution - Augmentation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/geodesica.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Geodesica&#34; alt=&#34;Geodesica&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;I recently read in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;Geodesica: Ascent&lt;/a&gt;, a new science fiction novel by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, a futurist example of augmentation as a method of maintaining extended social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;Geodesica: Ascent&lt;/a&gt; the protagonist, &amp;quot;Melilah&amp;quot; is a politician in the distant future. She has her own problems with the Dunbar Number, and solves it with her own personalized social networking service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two things she had learned from her political career were that society depended on interpersonal relationship networks, and that everything could turn on a simple misidentification. In her fifties she had set about ensuring that her memory remained in good working order in order to avoid the latter. Anthropologists had known since the twentieth century that people were born with a ceiling on their social groups. Once Melilah exceeded the Dunbar and Hill number of 150, and rapidly acquiring still more associates, it became progressively harder to keep track of everyone she had to know. As she passed her hundredth birthday, it became only worse. Some of her contemporaries option for cortical grafts and other memory prosthetics. She, motivated by a gut-level -- some would say irrational -- desire to keep her body as free of technology as possible, opted for other means.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She had found that using a name once every two months was enough to keep her memory fresh. Any longer than that between reminders, and the associations faded, rendering recall unreliable. So she programmed a complete list of her occasional acquaintances and enemies into a database and programmed it to cycle through them ever sixty days, shuffling the order each time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hundred years on, she was still in the habit of skimming fifty or so names a day, just to keep on the ball. By flicking through the images, voice files, place names, and more obtuse clues, she felt confident of recognizing any of the several thousand people more or less likely to interact with her at any point in the near future. The list had grown and shrunk down over the years, and many people had dropped off it entirely because of death or distance. Sometimes she added names to the list only to be surprised that they had been on it once before, decades ago, and she had forgotten them completely. That only reinforced the need for the list and the effort to keep it fresh in her mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure that the Dunbar Number problem is solely one of &amp;quot;recognition&amp;quot;, as illustrated by Williams and Dix. However, I think this is a great example of seeing how a traditional cultural solution to network overextension (namely, &amp;quot;Spending More Time&amp;quot;) can be better applied by Social Software. In this example Melilah&#39;s software automates the &amp;quot;ticklers&amp;quot; that politicians use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/spokekeepintouchsettings.gif&#34; title=&#34;Spokekeepintouchsettings&#34; alt=&#34;Spokekeepintouchsettings&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: right;&#34; /&gt;Already at least one social networking service has adopted a somewhat similar idea.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://center.spoke.com/person/personalProfileTab.spoke?id=[serverID=center,ID=4877427]&#34;&gt;Spoke&lt;/a&gt; has a &amp;quot;Keep In Touch&amp;quot; setting. The Spoke client software will watch your Outlook mailbox and addressbook to see how often you contact various people, and if you don&#39;t email them or modify your address book entry for them periodically, will remind you that you should contact them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never used Spoke&#39;s &amp;quot;Keep In Touch&amp;quot; feature -- largely for privacy reasons (I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html&#34;&gt;stung by a Zero Degrees&lt;/a&gt; Outlook extension), but also because Spoke seemed to be oriented toward salespeople and thus emphasized growing the network. My problem is not growing my network, but managing the network I already have more effectively. But I may have to take another look at Spoke. So, it doesn&#39;t quite offer the same solution that Melilah used in the far-future, but it&#39;s still a start upon that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions and Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not certain that Spoke&#39;s &amp;quot;Keep In Touch&amp;quot; feature, or Melilah&#39;s social recognition reminder service are the full solution to the &amp;quot;Dunbar Triage&amp;quot; problem. However, they do at least offer a few examples of people looking at the problems, and how social software can help solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;ve outlined here there are at least three traditional methods&amp;nbsp; that we&#39;ve used to manage Dunbar Triage prior to advent of social networking services: spending more time, changing standards, and prioritization. The technological solutions that I&#39;ve offered up as an example concentrates upon the first of those cultural solutions, but it is by no means a conclusive statement on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could next-generation social networking services improve upon the ideas of changing standards or prioritization? Could simple categorization help improve expectations for attention levels that various associates receive from you? Are there ways that social networking services, acting as an intermediary, could better manage disappointment-inducing events, such as a decision to spend less attention on an associate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More so, could social software offer solutions that aren&#39;t even being considered right now? For example, many Cyberpunk novels have suggested the ideas of avatars that can collect information for you on the &#39;net while your attention is elsewhere. Could these avatars likewise maintain more distant social networks for you, without your full attention? Would that function even be desirable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some solutions are not technological -- what new skills and changes to practices, etiquette and ethics are required for our ever expanding network of relationships? Or as &lt;a href=&#34;http://alevin.com/weblog/&#34;&gt;Adina&lt;/a&gt; asks: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Who will offer us a 21st century, internet-augmented take on Dale Carnegie and Emily Post?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any problem in the developing technical world, the first step is to define the problem and to consider possible solutions. Here&#39;s the start: social networks can become too large, and many social networking services are causing the problem rather than solving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s your solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I think the politicians and sales people use another strategy - they pretend that they keep up with the connections, but in fact they don&#39;t.
That&#39;s why they have the people to keep them informed about people they are going to meet. They don&#39;t remember the people but they use techniques to impress them that they do. And that is why we don&#39;t like them.
YASNS let us all switch into the politician networking mode.
For some time I have beed thinking that Huminity which bases the networking on IM buddy lists is a step in the direction of making SNS more balanced, since it bases the networking on the most scarce Internet resource - user attention.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Nice post. A few random thoughts:
This seems analogous to what happens when people move from rural communities with relatively sparse social options to the city.
Another prioritization scheme is to emphasize face to face relationships, or to distinguish between real-time and non-realtime relationships. These are not always appropriate filters, but because getting f2f or talking realtime requires a special effort, I&#39;ve found these approaches can help me gauge whether a relationship is maintainable.
The older system of etiquette, which separated personal from professional relationships, is another approach, though when I hear the words &#34;I don&#39;t do business with friends,&#34; it means someone neither a friend nor a business associate.
Perhaps there are some other frames for looking at this, e.g. time management or attention management, or as another instance of the Tyranny of Choice.  Approaching the problem as one of more choice in who we pick to be our friends and associates, or as one of more demand on us from others also colors our choice of solutions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;One way of putting the brakes on endlessly expanding contact lists is to have the SNS site charge per contact. If you really need more than 100 contacts then you&#39;d pay for them, but if not then when you&#39;ve got another 1 person you want to add to your list you&#39;d consider dropping one off your current list. It might work better with per-contact charges, so you&#39;re not forced into making a decision when you hit the package borders (101, 201, etc)
Not only does it counter the pack-rat mentality, but it also provides a business model.
Another idea I had was if the SNS would provide me with a continuous feed of updates and changes in the profiles of my contacts - I occasionally notice that some contact of mine has changed jobs, but more likely I wouldn&#39;t notice. The list of contacts just sit there, passive. This feedback would provide two forces: (1) the memory refreshing effect, and (2) the opportunity to drop those contacts that are moving into areas I don&#39;t care for.
A third idea: I&#39;d like it if the SNS I use (LinkedIn) allowed me to attach some notes or tags to each contact in my list ... I have a few there where I have to think really hard just how I happen to know them. Right now it seems that every SNS I look at lets me make connections, but every connection is bland and generic. The system is relying on me remembering why I know that person, when instead it could remember it for me.
When it comes time to triage, I&#39;d really like it if the SNS would provide a simple network map for me. Show me my immediate contacts, any connections they have amongst themselves, and my second circle contacts (anonymised if necessary). This way at least I can see that Person X is a gatekeeper to a whole different community from all my other contacts, and so should reconsider dropping them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Eric Scheid has the right idea... but his number of 100 is still too high.
His last paragraph is golden.  When I first joined RYZE  in 2002 [ no longer an active member] I mapped out my 1 and 2 step network there.  In the diagram linked below I am the green node, my immediate neighbors are in blue and my two step contacts are in grey.
The network map reveals why Eric&#39;s 100 number is too high...

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;This, and the earlier article on Dunbar numbers are interesting reading.  I&#39;m not sure whether the Dunbar number applies in all cases.
In some discussion on SNs recently, I theorised that if we analysed Social Networks that there would be people who maintained relationships in Groups, i.e meshes where everyone knows everyone.  Bridging between groups occurs because of multiple membership, i.e. person X knows all the parents in their kids soccer club, AND all the people at the office.  Dunbars number, and the theories around it, seem to apply here, i.e. to the social-grooming required in GROUPS.
There would also be people who maintain relationships, between a lot of people who mostly do NOT know each other. We used to call these people Networkers, and typically they are the people you call when you want to know who to talk to about some topic where you have no personal connections.  I&#39;m not sure whether the Dunbar number applies to those people&#39;s connections, probably the power-law applies better, i.e. they can maintain progressively more distant connections with progressively more people.
Anecdotal, if you randomly pick people in for example Orkut then you&#39;ll see the same names turn up as intermediates in many cases. This is not necessarily because those people have large numbers of Orkut friends, but because their Orkut friends are dispersed over a range of sub-groups.
I don&#39;t think that any of the SN tools do a good job of managing these kinds of relationships yet, in particular the lack of interworking between them causes problems as different Groups tend to belong to different SN systems, so the bridges are often not evident. Also the relative strength of a connection doesn&#39;t seem to drive the ranking of possible connections, i.e. I&#39;m just as likely to be presented with a potential introduction through a person with a weak connection to the target, than through someone with a strong connection.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;On tactic that comes to mind is the automated equivalent of an 18th/19th century butler, who mediated social interaction at a time when the intrusive, in-person visit was one of only two ways to make social contact.
The butler has broad and nuanced knowledged of the circumstances in which the Lady is to be acknowledged to be IN.
Today&#39;s online presence indicators are flat; they tell everyone the same message; that one is working, or eating ice cream in front of the television.
A butler would understand whether one is working or not, and would put through different connections at different hours.
A butler would understand the understand the nuances of one&#39;s social circle, and admit some people automatically, allowing others to wait, and requiring still others to leave a message.
We also need the 18th/19th century interface to the Butler, the calling card, which conveys by its printed message and accompanying whether the caller is a longlost relative whom the butler may not remember; a recommendation from a reputable source; a specific message about the urgency of the visit.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I think that the key to defeating the Dunbar number is to a) establish a real relationship to begin with and b) massage that relationship at least once per year.
I find that if I&#39;ve built a meaningful relationship with someone, based on some shared experiences, simply getting in touch with someone once a year on their birthday is enough to keep the relationship alive.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;You&#39;ve got to distinguish between &#34;friends&#34; and everything else - the relationships that range across acquaintance, association, colleague and just plain &#34;potentially useful.&#34; Why treat them all with the same UI? Why not invite your true friends to share a more intimate online relationship and keep the rest in the &#34;relationship parking lot&#34; of an Orkut? Yeah, I know that friends are often useful, too, but they deserve better than to share the same utilitarian role as that guy you met at SXSW last year.
I&#39;ll invite my real friends into my Grouper hangout, but I&#39;m not a Congressional Rep, so I don&#39;t need to be responsible to hundreds of familiar names. I&#39;ve got plenty of other things to do with my time, which I believe is the case with most of us.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Hi, Crhis. Three years&#39; ago Adrian Scott asked this question too, and it led to his founding Ryze...

Edge.org&#39;s Question Page of 2002 - by Adrian Scott.
******
&#34;How do we scale up the number of quality human relationships one person can sustain by many orders of magnitude? In an increasingly connected world, how does one person interact with a hundred thousand, a million or even a billion people?&#34;
Our one fixed resource is time — human attention. As we become increasingly networked in the technological sense, we also become more networked in the social sense.
As our social networks scale up, we move more and more of our interactions to the technological sphere. We can have many more telephone interactions than we can have hand-written letter interactions. When we move from telephone to e mail, the number of interactions between people goes up even more dramatically.
Then we pair our e-mail interactions with a personal Web site, and we start moving our personalities into the technology net, as a way of automating and scaling up the number of relationships even further.
We end up with personal CRM systems to handle our increased interaction load, and then add interfaces from our technology net to our human forms. These interfaces will develop from current-day Palm Pilots and Blackberry&#39;s to heads-up display style interfaces in glasses and eventually retinal and neuronal interfaces.
&#34;Hi Jerry, Ahh.., we met back in 1989, May 14th at 7pm, and since then we&#39;ve exchanged 187 e-mails and 39 phone calls. I hope your cousin&#39;s daughter Gina had a wonderful graduation yesterday.&#34;
The whole range of interactions becomes organized. Introductions from one person to another, and rating systems become automated.
Currently many people run into barriers as their personal networks approach the range of thousands of people. Soon they will move to the tens of thousands, to the millions and beyond.
With these trends, the friction costs of personal introductions go down, and consequently the value of quality measurement and gatekeeping go up dramatically. As the depth of knowledge in a relationship increases, the threshold point at which you &#39;really know someone&#39; increases also. It&#39;s an arms race of intimacy.

An Avatar? Maybe that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I look at life as a whole. Coincidences (for lack of a non-cliched word) are road signs helping us determine a direction of movement (not necessarily in the physical realm).
I&#39;m working on a software module which links coincidental interaction within Nature and published human consciousness. Currently I&#39;m modeling Climate Change.
For my software to ultimately work within a social network, a persons daily life of data would be connected via an identifier - and freely available. Too, an aspect of human momentum would need to change dramatically - we would trust that life is a whole and not something to be mastered, assimilated, conquered. We would need to move to a much less mechanical decentralized world. And our user base would need to be decreased.
Which coincidentally, Climate Change is forcing upon us. And it&#39;s ramping up.
Google, with all the tools I need (email, blog, webpages, and soon a social network site) seemed like a potential opportunity. They never responded to my email :)

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Learning by Subtraction
The human brain has on half the number of synapses at age six as it had at age two. It learns by subtraction. So do computer based neural nets.
This principle could well be applied to organizations to increase the size of the Dunbar number that could work effectively without drowning in bureaucracy.
Consider three ways to bring order in a human organization. The chain of command, community spirit and marketplace choice.
The chain of command tends to keep demanding ever more connections. You must get permission from all these people before taking action. The free intraprise systems we set up (See The Intelligent Organization by Gifford &amp; Elizabeth Pinchot and link at the end of this post) allow people to connect and disconnect at the end of each contract at will. Teams contract with line officers and each other to get the work done, much like a virtual organization except that key competencies and trade secrets remain in the organization.
Relationships that create value are maintained; those that consume value are terminated by either party. This provides a powerful advantage over the innane connections that are often maintained in highly time consuming ways in a bureaucracy.
The force of community also has a self-organizing quality that allows people to volunteer for what has juice and walk away from relationships that consume purpose and meaning. Community is a necessary balance to free enterprise or free intraprise. Both should be used in place of the chain of command in many of the situations where the chain of command is used today.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Adina: Getting in touch once a year may keep a relationship alive, but only just. This begs the question, what do you want from your relationships? What do you value them for? What is the point in keeping a relationship on drip-feed attention when putting so little in precludes the possibility of growth, of enrichment, of greater intimacy, of learning something, of sharing the experience of life in some way.
Perhaps what we&#39;ll see, with or without the help of clever internet applications, is a polarisation: a small circle of close friends, a very wide circle of friendly acquaintances (whether social, professional, shared interest, discussion group, blog reader, etc, by origin), and an almost infinite range of potential one-off contacts. Along the lines Chris Reh is suggesting, I think.
I&#39;m not sure I need to know which of my friendly acquaintances are in touch with one another. Better just to get on and live, and concentrate on putting something into those relationships, the better to get something out of them.
Or have I missed the point?

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Fred, is there someone in your household who sends birthday cards and holiday cards? These are traditional tools for staying minimally in touch. They don&#39;t maintain intimacy, but they do keep an open door, so that it&#39;s easier to keep the benefits of weak ties, and regain contact when the time is right.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I just had a minor realization: when we speak of &#34;dropping&#34; someone from our personal network, are we really doing that? The fact is, they are very probably connected to other people we do know, and so what we are really doing is *delegating* the intimate relationship to someone we also know. Being able to see a map of my local network would help a lot in deciding whether to cut someone loose or not.
