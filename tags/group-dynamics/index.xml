      <description>I was musing as I was preparing for next week&amp;#39;s Intensive at BGI that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That&amp;#39;s because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.
I talk about this a bit in my Group Threshold and Dunbar Number posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the&amp;#0160;“Judas Number” nadir, or low point.</description>

      <description>There is some more excellent research this week by Nick Yee and Nicolas Ducheneaut in the PlayOn blog. Again, their research provides good insight into social group dynamics as they appear in online games.
I last mentioned their research on guild sizes in my blog post Dunbar &amp;amp; World of Warcraft where I compare the distribution of guild sizes in Ultima Online vs PlayOn&amp;#39;s results from World of Warcraft. However, both distribution tables suffer from a variety of biases due to the nature of the different game designs, many of which are discussed in the commments in the post.</description>
