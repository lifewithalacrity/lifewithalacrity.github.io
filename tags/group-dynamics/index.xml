      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldcafe.com/bank_book.htm&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Power of Conversation&#34; class=&#34;at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c &#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c-320wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was musing as I was preparing for next week&amp;#39;s Intensive at &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2009/09/teaching-using-the-social-web-for-social-change-at-bgiedu.html&#34;&gt;BGI&lt;/a&gt; that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That&amp;#39;s because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk about this a bit in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html&#34;&gt;Group Threshold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number&#34;&gt;“Judas Number”&lt;/a&gt; nadir, or low point. These group threshold nadirs exist when groups are too large for some processes to function effectively, but too small for others to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am particularly aware of this threshold when I host small parties at my home. At 7 or so people everything just seems to work — conversations flow, everybody gets to participate, and everyone has fun. A the numbers climb past 10 I find that I as the host have to work harder, to be more aware of making sure that everyone is having a good time and that no one is left out. At some point as a party gets larger things just begin to flow again, as there are enough people that small groups can form and conversation flows well once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also seen this at business meetings. When my entrepreneurial companies were small an “all hands” meeting could be incredibly effective. All the issues and ideas got brought up, and everyone felt committed to our decisions. However, as these meeting grew, at some point the “all hands” meeting took too long and started requiring process and rules to be effective. The energy this consumed also diminished much of the efficacy of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border=1&#34; title=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34; height=&#34;137&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2434/3959741597_77ffe2ca15_m.jpg&#34; style=&#34;border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: black; border-right-color: black; border-bottom-color: black; border-left-color: black; &#34; title=&#34;Card from Four Table Braid&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One tool that I&amp;#39;ve used to manage these odd-sized groups in the past is what I call “The Braid”. It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldcafe.com/&#34;&gt;The World Café&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.conversationcafe.org/&#34;&gt;Conversation Café&lt;/a&gt; are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldcafe.com/articles/cafetogo.pdf&#34;&gt;Cafe To Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Braid is a little more organized then the more ad-hoc Café Method. When you start a meeting you are given a small card that tells you which table to sit at for each round. Each table is assigned a scribe for each round to take notes at the table, and to report out the notes to everyone who arrives for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about the organization of The Braid is that over the course of a number of rounds you&amp;#39;ll have a brand new group of people to talk to during each round. Thus over the course of an hour or so you&amp;#39;ll actually get to have a relatively short yet rich conversation with almost everyone in the room, rather than with just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;amp;gid=0&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Four Table Braid&#34; height=&#34;453&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/3960601974_652a29b96f.jpg&#34; width=&#34;433&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There are different forms of The Braid for different numbers of tables and sizes of groups, but my favorite is the Four Table Braid for groups of a minimum of 16 to a maximum of 28 people. One of the peculiar things about this Braid is that it seems to function well if people arrive at different times. The Braid fills first table A with 4 people so that they can begin talking, then fills table B, C, and D the same way. Once those tables are full, new arrivals are woven into The Braid one at a time until all tables have 5 people, then 6, then the max of 7 for a total of 28 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice thing about the Four Table Braid is that no one needs to be the scribe more then once; the task is equally shared among all but the last 8 to arrive in a group of 28. Also, in just 4 rounds with 16 people, 90%+ of the participants have met. With 28 people, you simply only need 5 rounds to match the same 90%+ meeting percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find The Braid useful for a variety of different situations. The simplest usage is as a group warming and introduction exercise. You need not do more then two or three rounds in order for more than half of the people to have met each other. The Braid is also useful with a focused objective. For instance, I once used it after a game designers&amp;#39; conference, with each table having a list of &amp;quot;game design laws&amp;quot; where the participants were asked to either give an example that was in favor of the law or contradicted the law. It also can be useful in combination with a variety of other group process techniques, for instance after an MG Taylor Take-A-Panel, where each participant first creates a page telling a story about themselves 15 years in the future and then the group uses The Braid to discover common insights. The Braid can also be good before an Open Space or other unconference event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am including here my templates for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf&#34;&gt;Four Table Braid&lt;/a&gt;. It includes 28 cards for printing on Avery business card paper, 4 table pages with instructions for participants, and 1 page with instructions for the host. I make these available as &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/&#34; rel=&#34;license&#34;&gt;CC-BY-NC-SA&lt;/a&gt; license. I welcome any DTP folks out there who would like to make these documents more functional or more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Three Table Braid is easy to figure out by hand, but larger Braids are more difficult. I&amp;#39;ve never figured out an algorithm for designing these quickly (any math wizzes out there?) so I&amp;#39;ve posted my &lt;a href=&#34;http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;amp;gid=0&#34;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; for the Four Table Braid for those of you who might wish to figure out how to implement larger numbers of tables. I would love to have a Ten Table Braid as a warm up exercise for a small unconference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dunbar Number &amp; Group Cohesion</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2005 16:16:17 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is some more excellent research this week by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickyee.com/&#34;&gt;Nick Yee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parc.com/nicolas&#34;&gt;Nicolas Ducheneaut&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/&#34;&gt;PlayOn&lt;/a&gt; blog. Again, their research provides good insight into social group dynamics as they appear in online games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I last mentioned their research on guild sizes in my blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar &amp;amp; World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; where I compare the distribution of guild sizes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uo.com/&#34;&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/a&gt; vs PlayOn&amp;#39;s results from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/&#34;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. However, both distribution tables suffer from a variety of biases due to the nature of the different game designs, many of which are discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html#comments&#34;&gt;commments in the post&lt;/a&gt;. For instance both guild graphs include &amp;quot;alts&amp;quot;, which are alternative characters of individual players. Thus one player might be represented multiple times in a guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nic &amp;amp; Nick&amp;#39;s more recent research, they are looking deeper and are &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html&#34;&gt;mapping social networks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090425222428/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; on World of Warcraft. Using tools available to them, over the course of the month of August they looked at 241,378 characters and 5569 guilds. From that data they were able to able to discover how often guild members were co-present (online at the same time) or co-located (online and in the same zone in the game)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;G-3&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-500wi&#34; title=&#34;G-3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in this map you can see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...we have a guild where we see more distinct cliques. There&amp;#39;s a somewhat hard-core 4 character cluster on the left- hand side, a mid-level triad on the bottom left, a mid 20&amp;#39;s clique that&amp;#39;s held together by the druid in the middle, and finally a more casual low-level clique on the top right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this same data, they then looked at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;max subgraph size of guilds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. A &amp;quot;subgraph&amp;quot; in a social network can be thought of as a &amp;quot;clique&amp;quot; of people that interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image005&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image005&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the social network of this guild there are 5 subgraphs, 4 of which are just 2 people and 1 subgraph that is of 6. The 4 subgraphs that are only of 2 people are members of the guild who did not participate much in the guild. But the number of people in the subgraph of 6 is much more interesting, as it shows that these members are &amp;quot;cohesive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the max subgraph size of a guild is plotted against the guild size, you get some interesting results -- the maximum guild cohesiveness occurs around the guild size of 50. Larger then that, guilds have a much more difficult time remaining cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image011&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image011&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results strong support my hypothesis in my original &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; post, where I...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&amp;#39;t have requisite variety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some possible other support for this hypothesis comes from another post by Nic &amp;amp; Nick where they analyze the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html&#34;&gt;time guilds spend together&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;(now 404, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20081119142033/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image004&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image004&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the mean amount of time that guilds spend together in the band 31 - 60 is only 95 minutes and that the standard deviation is the lowest, as compared to groups that are larger then 120 where the mean time is 141 minutes at the standard deviation is higher. This says to me that keeping a large group cohesive requires significantly more time in social &amp;quot;grooming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my original &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html&#34;&gt;Dunbar Number&lt;/a&gt; post I had a secondary hypothesis where I talk about peak in satisfaction in smaller groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of &amp;quot;team&amp;quot; really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough &amp;quot;attention&amp;quot; is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is strong support for this in another plot found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;max subgraph size of guilds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;(now 404, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20081231143011/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; post where they compare the subgraph ration to guild sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image013&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/previous/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-500wi&#34; title=&#34;Image013&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see a strong peak at 10 people, that rapidly falls with guild size. This shows that guild cohesion is relatively easy to maintain up to size 10, but becomes much more difficult to maintain as guilds grow larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been saying for some time that studying online games is a valuable place to understanding social software. I&amp;#39;m quite pleased that this research is proving this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Chris, intersting data.
I am not sure that with standard deviations so high on the &#34;Time spent together by guild size&#34; that you can draw super strong conclusions about differences been group cohesiveness by group.  One or two extra-connected group is going to throw off your numbers quite a bit.  If you have the data and can scatterplot them instead of showing averages I suspect you&#39;ll be able to make a case more clear.
&lt;/p&gt;

I would also like to see a scatterplot.  It would really help to make time spent together by guilds alot more clearer.

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;The military, and educational institutions, have discovered similar thresholds for collectivities. I think the number of friends any of us can sustain, in any manner (on, offline) is around 200. And that&#39;s pushing it. Magic numbers in small business are 12 and approx 30-35, I believe. Intersting that it might hold for online as well as offline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Great series on Dunbar limit. One minor nitpick - I think your first PlayOn image link might be wrong. I thing the text you&#39;ve quoted refers to their bottom-left image which is g-3 rather than g-4 (the 4-character cluster is *really* obvious in g-3).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Thanks, the image is corrected to be g-3.
