[This is the third in a series of articles on collective choice, co-written by my collegue Shannon Appelcline. It will be jointly posted in Shannon&#39;s Trials, Triumphs &amp;amp; Trivialities online games column at Skotos.]
In our first article on collective choice we outlined a number of different types of choice systems, among them voting, polling, rating, and ranking. Since then we&#39;ve been spending some time expanding upon the systems, with the goal being to create both a lexicon of and a dialogue about systems for collective choice.</description>

[Shannon Appelcline is a friend and colleague of mine at Skotos, an online game company.

The origin of these discussions have varied from &amp;quot;what makes this board game work?&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;how can we give our players more control of our online games?&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;how do we make decisions in our company?</description>
