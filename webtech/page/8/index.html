		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>At a recent unofficial gathering of <a href=http://finnern.com/future/>Future Salon'ers</a>, there was a discussion about a <a href=http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/1218/sony_06.wmv>demonstration of four robots doing a japanese fan dance to music</a> (I think it was seen at CES in Las Vegas last week). The remark was that it was vaguely disturbing because your intellect knows that they are just robots, but someplace deep in your brain you know that they are alive because of the way that they move.</p>

<p>There actually a wonderful web page on this topic, called <a href=http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/glimpses/valley.html>The Uncanny Valley: Why Why are monster-movie zombies so horrifying and talking animals so fascinating?</a> by <a href=http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/>Dave Bryant</a>.</p>

<blockquote>(Japanese roboticist Doctor Masahiro Mori) is not exactly a household name — but, for the speculative fiction community at least, he could prove to be an important one. The reason why can be summed up in a simple, strangely elegant phrase that translates into English as "the uncanny valley".

<p>Though originally intended to provide an insight into human psychological reaction to robotic design, the concept expressed by this phrase is equally applicable to interactions with nearly any nonhuman entity. Stated simply, the idea is that if one were to plot emotional response against similarity to human appearance and movement, the curve is not a sure, steady upward trend. Instead, there is a peak shortly before one reaches a completely human "look"... but then a deep chasm plunges below neutrality into a strongly negative response before rebounding to a second peak where resemblance to humanity is complete.</blockquote>The topic of the "Uncanny Valley" has also come up recently in a column by the movie critic Rodger Ebert, <a href=http://www.suntimes.com/output/answ-man/sho-sunday-ebert11.html>Gollum stuck in 'Uncanny Valley' of the 'Rings'</a>, where he answers a question from a reader <i>"Should Andy Serkis, the actor of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, get an Oscar?"</i> where Ebert states:<p></p>

<blockquote>The genius of Gollum is that it seems like a convincingly real creature -- but not one we have ever seen before, so that its realism does not seem creepy except in the ordinary way. If Serkis brought Gollum to life, other artists fine-tuned the balance with the Uncanny Valley. So this is something other than a conventional performance, and should not compete against characters of a different nature. Perhaps a new category is called for? Beyond the Oscar of the Uncanniest Valley?</blockquote>I believe that the "Uncanny Valley" also applies to a number of other successes and failures in computer interface design. We loved <a href=http://www.bu.edu/jlengel/kn65kfs.mov>Apple's "Knowledge Navigator" video</a>, but in practice avatar-based systems have not been successful as they become a turn-off. Witness Microsoft's "Bob" and even Word's Paperclip avatar. When we see a little personality, a little "aliveness", we want a lot more, or it becomes annoying and we turn it off. However, the more "dead" it is, we are willing to forgive a lot.

<p>The "Uncanny Valley" also relates to my previous post <a href=../../../2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html>Seven Fingers of the Hand</a>, as part of the art of a circus is entering and leaving the valley. As a contortionist amazes you she is entering the Uncanny Valley. As the the clown amuses you he is entering the valley. When they come back to earth and join the others, they are human again.</p>

                                <p><a href=http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/23/bloggers_block_collapsing_facets_and_the_number_150.html>Joi Ito's Web: Blogger's block, collapsing facets and the number 150</a> offers some insights on two different topics:</p>

<p>The first is on the nature of identity when we write in our blogs:<blockquote>"The depth of my identity is becoming shallow because the context has collapsed."</blockquote>I have a lot of sympathy with this but from a slightly different perspective -- I have so many different 'identities' of who and what I am and what I'm interested in that it makes it hard for a stranger to be able to understand me if I try to cover it in one blog. Yet without those other identities I am not truely 'whole'.<p></p>

<p>Joi attributes this collapse of context due to the size of groups:<blockquote><a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/02/12.html#a284>Ross Mayfield broke the networks down</a> into political, social and creative at 1000's, 150 and 12, but my feeling is that the political layer is 10's of thousands and next layer is business at 500 and social at 150 and creative at 12. This is not scientific, but just my personal observation. If this is true, this blog is approaching the political layer which explains why I feel that I get more business done on LinkedIn, but I feel much more candid and happy on IRC and Chat and why I still really love dinner conversations most of all. I think that if you can manage the audience size and composition on your blog, you can tune it to any of these layers.</blockquote>I'm also convinced that the nature of the size of groups affects the group dynamics of those groups, and your relationship with others in those groups. I may disagree on the exact ranges of sizes (my observations map the creative team/family/committee 5-9, tribe/clan 25-81, association 125-300 (note the gaps)) but the I agree with the basic principle.<p></p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>Shannon Appelcline's <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_.shtml>"Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities"</a> column in the <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/>Skotos Articles section</a> recently featured a trilogy of articles about stretching the bounds of socialization in online games:</p>

<p><b><a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_136.phtml>Social Gaming Interactions, Part One: A History of Form</a></b></p>

<p>The first article outlines the problem by looking out how social interaction has traditionally been handled in online games, and by considering how limiting these interactions typically have been. It also outlines how to expand traditional social interactions by describing three main categories of social interaction: competition, cooperation, and freeform.<blockquote>That the majority of MMORPGs, MUDs, and other multiplayer games ultimately support achiever players over socializers, or even killers, I think begins to outline how poorly we understand--and support--true social interactions in today's multiplayer games.</blockquote><b><a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_137.phtml>Social Gaming, Part Two: Competition</a></b><p></p>

<p>The second article expands upon the competitive category of social interaction. Besides touching upon traditional direct competition, it also considers resource competition, economic competition, and the role of bluffing in competition. A number of examples are drawn from tabletop board games.<blockquote>In looking at competitive interaction I intend to first consider some forms of competitive interaction that we've sort of covered--direct competition and resource competition--but will show how even in these "well known" interactions we've just scratched the surface. Afterward we'll get into some less explored possibilities: economic competition and bluffing. The end result? More variability in competition, more viability and for the players, ultimately, more fun.</blockquote><b><a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_138.phtml>Social Gaming Interactions, Part Three: Cooperation &amp; Freeform</a></b><p></p>

<p>The third and final article expands upon the other two categories of social interaction: cooperation and freeform. Within cooperative interaction we find a spectrum of possibilities varied by the immediacy of the cooperators. Freeform interaction is given a more generalized overview, covering some of the reasons it appears and how to encourage it.<blockquote>In Richard Bartle's categorization of multiplayer gamers, he very broadly touches upon "socializers"--players who are there because they want to interact not just with the game system, but also with other people. I actually believe there's a lot more granularity to the category of socializers than just its simple name. The biggest subset of socializers is, I believe, the cooperative players--those who are working together within the game system toward a specific goal. A few different MMORPGs have tried to appeal to this group, but as with competitive gamers there's also more we can learn from the word of tabletop games.</blockquote>My personal belief is that the so-called "socializer MMPORGs" -- Sims Online, There, Second Life, etc. -- have missed the boat by not really understanding the socializer, or treating them like they are achievers. If someone can figure out how to break out of that trap, there may be a new hugely successful MMPORG game opportunity available.<p></p>

                                <p>I've received a number of replies and pointers after posting my <a href=../../../2003/12/evaluating_soci.html>Evaluating Social Network Services</a> here last Tuesday. Here are a few:</p>

<p><b>Invite Issues</b></p>

<p>Esther Dyson writes in her blog about invite issues for her favorite social networking service in <a href=http://release4.blogspot.com/>Some Comments on LinkedIn</a>:<blockquote>I am getting a lot of invitations from people I don't know. It would be great to have a button that says "See inviter's profile" that links directly from the confirm-or decline-invitation page.<p></p>

<p>Also, on the invitations page, the service should include some advice: "Do not invite people who do not know you. If you are not sure, at least give them a hint of who you are ... how you met, etc. If you are not sure or that effort is too much work for a particular person, perhaps you do not know that person well enough." </p>

<p>My sense is that people are starting to invite everyone in their address book. That may goose statistics, but the key is the signal, not the noise. ANd, of course, too much noise will drown out the signal.</blockquote>In <a href=http://www.ginx.com/%7Epierre/archives/000104.html>Pierre's Web</a>, Pierre writes that he is having issues with the amount of spam-like messages he recieves from LinkedIn when the lauched the service to upload your outlook address book:<blockquote>I've been getting too many of these e-mails. Since I haven't used this new 'feature' of LinkedIn, I don't know if these messages are automated or manually triggered. They all have the same text, so they seem automatic. I've decided I'm going to decline or ignore these unless I get a personal note. Roughly 1 out of 3 comes from someone whose name I recognize. But people I know well don't send me these -- they send me direct invitations.</blockquote>In <a href=http://werbach.com/blog/>Werblog</a> Kevin Werbach comments on both Esther &amp; Pierre's issues at <a href=http://werbach.com/blog/2003/12/13.html#a1336>When is a Connection Not a Connection</a>:<blockquote>(The) problem is that the social networking services don't have a field for "do I really know this individual personally?"  Having someone's email address in Outlook isn't necessarily a proxy for a relationship.  Yesterday I got a request through Spoke to forward an invitation to Paul Krugman, the New York Times columnist.  I knew both the sender and the next person in the chain, and the request was reasonable, so I forwarded it on.  The recipient wrote back to say that his only link to Krugman was sending him one email last year commenting on a column.  Krugman never responded.  Not exactly a "trusted connection."</blockquote><a href=http://www.iunctura.com/_justinhitt/>Justin Hitt</a> wrote me an email in response to my <a href=../../../2003/12/evaluating_soci.html>evaluation blog entry</a>:<blockquote>You also address an important issue that the degree of a relationship is important -- (for example) I'd like to connect with you through LinkedIn, but we only know of each other. While we have a mutual connection of Thomas Powers -- I don't know anything about your challenges as a business owner.<p></p>

<p>Of course, when I update my address books with people I've interacted with in the last 30 days, you'll automatically become a part of my network. The real importance of this type of pseudo-relationship is that it's turned into something. Either I have to provide value to you, or you to me, or together to another party.</p>

<p>Perhaps the perfect system would let me assign a degree of relationship strength (like the Spoke system)-- you'd start as a 1, but over time could be upgraded to a 10 if we are of value to each other.</blockquote><br>
<b>Differing Values of Networks</b><p></p>

<p>In <a href=http://werbach.com/blog/>Werblog</a> Kevin Werbach continues in the same blog posting an important observation about <a href=http://werbach.com/blog/2003/12/13.html#a1336>the differing values of a social network</a>:<blockquote>Pierre Omidyar and Esther Dyson both complain about getting spammed by invitations through business-oriented social networking services such as LinkedIn. <br>
....<br>
(The) most connected people need them the least.  Esther and Pierre don't need LinkedIn to reach pretty much anyone they want to contact.  Yet there are a whole lot of folks who want to reach them, and don't have a personal connection to do so.  So the service worsens their email overload with little corresponding benefit. I'm somewhat in the same boat.  I'm certainly not as well-known as Esther and Pierre, but I have a pretty good network in the tech industry.  I haven't yet found a situation where LinkedIn got me to someone I couldn't reach directly, by Googling for an email address, or by guessing a mutual connection.</blockquote>Mike on TechDirt further supports this issue in <a href=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20031215/132222_F.shtml>Social Networking Services Brings Out Critics</a>:<blockquote>I was part of a company that tried to build just such a solution in the 90s, and we discovered that people who have valuable rolodexes realize there's value in keeping those rolodexes private. They're not comfortable with handing them out. At the same time, the people who most need to use such a service are those with the fewest connections. In other words, social networking services are often a system for subsidizing the poor networking skills of the unconnected with the strong networking skills of the well connected. The people who are the most valuable to the system only end up with more spam from random people trying to reach them.<br>

<b>Endorsement Issues</b><p></p>

<p><a href=http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/>Jon Udel </a> writes in <a href=http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/12/16.html#a870>The LinkedIn dilemma</a>:<blockquote>Here's what stopped me from writing an endorsement for somebody on LinkedIn today: the requirement to define our relationship as one of these choices<br>
...<br>
The same kind of thing stopped me from joining the identity-badge party at the Digital ID conference recently. I'm bugged by forms that invite or require me to specify the unspecifiable.<br>
...<br>
I understand the impulse to codify social protocols in software. I'm not at all sure we can do it in ways that preserve the necessary fluidity and fuzziness. But there's VC money in them thar hills, so I guess we're going to do the experiment and find out.</blockquote>Mike on TechDirt writes in <a href=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20030917/1141243.shtml>The Social Networking Bubble Gets A Bit More Hot Air</a>:<blockquote>I never got a chance to ask my question about whether some of these "explicit social networking" systems can actually cause harm to real social connections. While both Friendster and LinkedIn claim that since you approve your connections, you guarantee that they're people you "endorse". However, that makes it sound like a binary decision. If they're in your network, you endorse them. That's not true.<p></p>

<p>Let's say I want to contact a hotshot at a big company, and see that he's connected to a friend of mine. What if (a) that friend is getting so many requests to have people introduce him to the hotshot and (b) he thinks that introducing me to that hotshot will harm his relationship with that hotshot. Instead, he's now harmed his relationship with me, because now I know, explicitly, that he doesn't want to introduce me to someone.</p>

<p>Sometimes things are better left unstated, and some of these social networks are going to discover these problems as they expand. Already, I've heard of people trying to figure out what to do about people they don't like adding them to their Friendster network. You don't want to turn down people and insult them, but each of those connections makes the whole thing less valuable.</blockquote><br>
<b>Understanding Customers</b><p></p>

<p><a href=http://www.iunctura.com/_justinhitt/>Justin Hitt</a> has an interesting take that social networking software has more value then establishing new contacts, in his blog <a href=http://iunctura.com/weblog/2003/12/17.html>How I use social software for stronger business relationships</a> (reg required) :<blockquote>Right now I'm primarily using these interactions to study the usefulness of such mediums.  It seems a lot of people just want to chat about things and the real decision makers aren't in the systems.  At times I'm convinced that social software is a tool of the unproductive, until I met more serious business networks like LinkedIn and Spoke.<p></p>

<p>Like any community you only get what you put in.  The relationship strategies I share here apply in social software environments.  I've gained new clients and business partners through each network, but that's not my primary interest of participating.  In fact, you should only have one reason of accessing these environments, that one reason is to...</p>

<p><i>Connect with existing customers to make sure you satisfy their every desire.</i></p>

<p>I've learned more about my existing customers by taking this final step.  After focusing on my area of expertise, creating a profile, and seeking to provide value -- I have created more return by using social software to improve the relationships I already have.</blockquote><br>
<b>Explicit Connections</b><p></p>

<p>Related to Justin's comments above, at <a www.ratcliffeblog.com"="" href"http:="">RatcliffeBlog</a> <a href=http://www.ratcliffe.com/About.htm>Mitch Ratcliffe</a> writes in <a 000074.html"="" www.ratcliffeblog.com="" archives="" href"http:="">Social Networking Deconstructed</a> about problems with a Spoke referral not working, and adds:<blockquote>At the same time, what is interesting about the social networking technology is that it forces requests into a semi-public venue, making us think about them more explicitly. I'm not sure that does much in terms of making successful connections today, though it certainly makes the "pain" social networking software hopes to address more explicit.<br>
...<br>
It remains to be seen if the social networkers will get the capital to learn these lessons, but I am hopeful that they will succeed. In the meantime, it is clear to me that the more purposeful the networking service offered, the more successful it will be in satisfying users' expectations. If anything, the social networks today are suffering from a lack of clarity about what they offer, so that all sorts of crazy expectations, like the idea that relationships will become frictionless, get lathered onto the term "social networks."</blockquote>Social Software researcher <a href=http://www.zephoria.org>Danah Boyd</a> writes in <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/snt/archives/001374.html>comment</a> to the above article:<blockquote>I love social networks. They are a part of all of our daily lives and i'm in awe of the sociologists who have dedicated themselves for so many years to figure out how people negotiate them. But as more and more technologists take on the social networks meme, they continue to mutate the concept and thus destroy much of the underlying theory that relies on certain fundamental ideas about interaction.</blockquote>I have this concern as well -- technologists (and coders, cryptographers, economists, and mathematicians) have a habit of taking small trends or behaviors and mapping them identically at all scales, big and small, past and future. Or another way to describe it, they see a tool like a stick of dynamite and want to use it to drive nails and travel to mars. I expect that we don't know enough about social software dynamics to understand how it works at different scales.<p></p>

<p><b>Usefulness of Social Network Services</b></p>

<p>Mike on TechDirt writes in <a href=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20030605/0258223.shtml>It's All about Who You Know</a>:<blockquote>It certainly seems like there's a trend to create these types of online "meet markets" for business or for pleasure. Why am I not impressed? First, I remember a similar company from a few years back called sixdegrees.com that had a ridiculous amount of hype before eventually folding. It turns out that many people have fun entering in the names of their friends at first - but very quickly lose interest. No one updates their lists, and no one does much beyond a little poking around. It's fun to see who your friends know, but most people aren't comfortable asking friends to be put in touch with their other friends. While it is a core part of networking, these systems often feel like spying on just who your friends' friends are.<br>
...<br>
The biggest thing is that the people you know in your network have tremendous value to you. Most people don't like to give up their rolodex. They know it's valuable, and they want to keep it in a position where they can leverage it - and not have to worry about random people (even if they know them) sniffing through it. They don't mind making introductions when they think it makes sense, but they get annoyed when someone approaches them and asks them to make an introduction. Also, there is much more value to me, if someone I know introduces me to someone because they thought it would be good if I knew that person. Any time I got an introduction through a system like LinkedIn, that connection would immediately have lower priority, because I would think that the person trying to contact me specifically tried to track me down - rather than the person linking us realizing that we should talk. </blockquote><a href="">Scott Loftesness</a> wrote me back after my <a href=../../../2003/12/evaluating_soci.html>evaluation</a> yesterday to say:<blockquote>As it turns out, I've not actually used LinkedIn much.  A couple of weeks ago -- after signing up for the service months ago -- I got bored on a weekend and went in to look at it again.  I found some folks (through just searching for financial services folks) that I knew.  I sent them invitations, etc.  Probably sent out a total of 40+ invitations (you included).  All but a few of those invitations were acceptance -- and my network jumped to something over 60 as a result.<p></p>

<p>In terms of actually using the service, I've yet to use it for anything productive for me.  I've responded to exactly two introduction requests -- being in the middle of a five party chain to get from originator to receiver.  Both looked legit -- and I passed both on and it looks like they've been forwarded all the way to the receiver.</p>

<p>I've got LinkedIn enabled so that browsing members can contact me directly.  I've received one inquiry via that route -- but it was way off my subject matter expertise so I just responded saying so.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, in the last 2-3 days, I've had 2-3 requests to join other people's LinkedIn networks -- after going for many days in between earlier invitations.</blockquote><br>
<b>Other Services</b><p></p>

<p>There are quite a few other services that I haven't explored yet, like Spoke Software and Zero Degrees, and there are other software or services like Contact Network, InterAction, Plaxo, Skype, Eurekster, Tickle, MeetUp. I hope to take a look at a few of them and report back soon. I don't think that I'll be looking at the dating sites such as Match.com, American Singles, Yahoo Personals, etc.</p>

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=http://www.infoworld.com>InfoWorld</a> has an article by <a href=http://www.infoworld.com/columnists/ephraim_reality.html>Ephraim Schwartz</a> called <a href=http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/12/15/49NNsocial_1.html>"Social Networking Targets the Enterprise"</a> that says that corporations are looking to use social networking service features in their CRM (customer relationship management) software. They mention a couple of companies that will be offering this, Contact Network, Interface Software, Spoke Software, and ZeroDegrees.<blockquote>For example, the ZeroDegrees dashboard would allow a person in furniture sales to be alerted when a large company leases more space or places ads for employees, thus indicating expansion and the need to furnish new office space, said Jas Dhillon, CEO of ZeroDegrees.<br>
...<br>
Other vendors ramping up their capabilities include Spoke Software. Next year the company will add a hosted service to its current on-premise solution. Spoke claims it has doubled the size of its relationship base from 5 million to 10 million people a user can access. <br>
...<br>
Law firm Honigman, Miller, Schwartz, and Cohn used Interface Software's InterAction suite to land lucrative accounts, according to Cynthia Reaves, partner at the firm. "We use InterAction to strategize about how to approach a client and develop teams of people to approach a potential client on a particular matter," Reaves said. <p></p>

<p>Interface is unique in that its social networking capability is a single feature in a complete CRM application for the professional services industry. It also uses outside content from companies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Hoover's to extend and improve the quality of potential contacts.<br>
...<br>
"Companies like Siebel and Salesforce.com are watching this space. These social networking companies will be gobbled up real quick," Pombriant said. </p>

<p>Pombriant believes the two exceptions are Interface Software, which offers a full CRM product, and perhaps ZeroDegrees, if it can deliver on its promise of extending its capabilities out to sales intelligence. </p>

<p>Social networking as a phenomenon is helping CRM improve the speed of closing a deal, but with a different twist, according to Pombriant. "We are no longer interested in buckshotting the marketplace to do indiscriminate selling. Social networking is trying to identify the best opportunity and people to pitch those opportunities to," Pombriant said.</blockquote>It will be interesting to see how this intersection of CRM, sales support software, and social network services will play out. At least there is a decent business model here.<p></p>

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>After a week where I met a number of bloggers and social network / social software people, I decided to try to update my various networks at <a href=http://www.ryze.com/>Ryze</a>, <a href=http://www.tribe.net/>Tribe.Net</a>, <a href=http://www.linkedin.com/>LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=http://www.friendster.com/>Friendster</a>.</p>

<p>These are my observations of these social network services after a few weeks of work.</p>

<h3>Overview of Social Network Services</h3>

<h4><a href=http://www.ryze.com/go/ChristopherA>ChristopherA @ Ryze</a></h4>
This was the first social network service that I signed up that seemed to already have some of my friends on it. At the urging of <a href=http://www.henshall.com/blog/>Stuart Henshall</a> I put a little more effort into it and got a half-dozen connections. After last week, when I met more social software people in person, and a bunch of link requests, I now have 22 'friends'.

<p>Ryze has the clunkiest interface of the four major social network services -- your personal home page starts with a two column profile that is professionally oriented, but has difficulty if you have more then one affliliation. Below this standard profile you can use some HTML to create a better looking section, but for non-HTML users it is difficult. Finally, the page ends with a Guestbook, which other other service members can post comments in.</p>

<p>One of my favorite features in Ryze is that when you click on a friend or potential friend, it shows you all the connections that you have between yourself and that person through your friends and friends of friends. Some of course will be obvious (as you run the the same circles) but sometimes you will find a completely different connection than you anticpated. Related, once you sign in the site home page will show you small pictures and first names of various friends of friends, and you'll sometimes recognize some of them and ask them to join your network.</p>

<p>A clunky feature, but one that shows promise, is that when you see another person's profile, you can reveal selectively your business phone number, your email address, your home phone, or your cell phone. You can do this for anyone individually, or you can set rules such that friends automatically get some of this  information.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things about Ryze is its orientation toward having physical gatherings, such as parties. There various events going on every week. As they charge for many of these events, thus Ryse has sort of a business model. I've not attended any parties yet, but I've been told by at least one professional that she has gotten business from them.</p>

<p>Besides the clunkiness of the interface and your personal home page, the worst thing about Ryze is that it is a little too open by default. To add someone as a friend takes a single click, and you get no opportunity to say why someone should join your network. Though that makes it easier to add people, on the recieving side I ended up with a number of people who wanted to add me as a friend when I had no idea who they were. The other level of openness is the guestbook -- I suppose it is supposed to serve as a combination of introduction and endorsement, but in practice it is almost spam. Guestbook entries are automatically visible, and you have to go through a clunky interface to hide them.</p>

<h4><a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">ChristopherA @ Tribe.Net</a></h4>
Tribe.Net was the second service I signed up for, and I currently have 24 friends.

<p>The name of this service exemplifies what I like most about Tribe.net -- by design you have multiple affiliations, or tribes.Each tribe has a message board, so 'intentional communities' is an important part of this service.  In fact, this site almost hides your professional information, putting it under a secondary tab, but unfortunately, this tab also only allows for one affiliation per member.</p>

<p>Another unique thing about Tribe.Net is the classified listings -- you see on various pages listings of requests and to a lesser extent offers from your social network.</p>

<p>The biggest weakness with Tribe.Net is that it lacks the ability to personalize very much. Your personal home page is mainly lists, and thus your personalization is largely limited to your photo.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">ChristopherA @ LinkedIn</a></h4>
LinkedIn is the most professional looking of all the social networking services that I've looked at so far, and is very oriented toward your professional network and not your broader personal network. In fact, unlike almost all the other sites, LinkedIn doesn't allow for you to add a photo your your personal page. I currently have 20 "connections" (they don't call them friends).

<p>My favorite part of LinkedIn is that it has a very good resume engine. Basically you put in all of your recent job history, with dates, and the software displays it in a form that looks a lot like a resume. This is the only social networking service that I've found so far that lets you have multiple current professional affilations, which for me is important. Unfortunately, this site does not allow you to easily list your non-professional affiliations, nor does it allow for you to separate job-type affilations with lesser type affiliations like 'investor', 'member of professional association', etc.</p>

<p>An important strength and weakness to LinkedIn is that it is much more protective of your privacy. You can't add anyone to your network unless you know their name and email address, or you have to get a referral from someone who is already your friend. This makes this service much more professional respectable then the other social networking services, which are more casual. For busy and well connected people like <a href=http://release4.blogspot.com/>Esther Dyson</a> this is very important.</p>

<p>I've only recently joined LinkedIn, so I haven't had a chance to use it's requests feature yet, but in at least the area of Venture Capital, it seems quite powerful. When I searched on this I got over 500 people that were somehow connected to my social network that I might be able to ask a friend for an introduction to.</p>

<p>The biggest weaknesss of this site is that it tries to be completely self-contained. It doesn't let you list your website, blogs, or give out your personal information selectively like Ryse does. The only external information that it allows you to share is your email address, and that only to friends.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=4608201">ChristopherA @ Friendster</a></h4>
This is the most recent social networking service that I have joined. Designed originally for dating, I had not played around with it as I'm in a long-term relationship. However, after hearing <a href=http://www.danah.org/>Danah Boyd</a> talke about it her blogs, I realized that it has evolved beyond that.

<p>The nicest thing about Friendster is its simplicity. There are 13 entries to fill out, ranging from gender to favorite movies. Unfortunately the site has become a bit over-popular with the under-25 crowd lately, so it can be very slow in the evenings. Because it was a dating site, the photo links are important, and the actual photos show up larger on this site then they do on any other site, making your photo on your personal page even more important.</p>

<p>The biggest weakness to Friendster is also that simplicity -- it is not oriented toward professional connections, nor to your group affiliations. It is just about you and your immediate friends. This makes Frienster the most "status" oriented of the various sites. It becomes more important to see how many friends you have, and how many endorsements you can get.</p>

<h4>Others</h4>
The first social networking service that I ever tried was Friendly Favors, now Living Directory, which I am at <a href="http://www.livingdirectory.org/display/my_profile.php?PHPSESSID=c029fc94040c8bd88ec39e3e8e4dacef">ChristopherA @ LivingDirectory</a>. However, I've never been able to find many of my associates already on this system. This site was oriented toward the idea of trading favors and has a heavy non-profit orientation. But without being able to find people that I know already signed up, it hasn't worked for me. One obstacle that I had when I first joined, which may have gone away, was that you needed a sponsor to join.

<p>A site that is not normally considered social networking software, but I believe should be is LiveJournal, where I am <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/christophera_/>ChristopherA_ at LiveJournal</a>. This is primarily a blog site, however, because other LiveJournal members are the only ones allowed to post comments on your site, and there is a "friends" link that shows the top entries of your friend's LiveJournal sites. This results in some of the behaviors that I've seen on Friendster and Ryze happen at LiveJournal.</p>

<h3>Barriers of Entry</h3>
The first barrier of entry to these social networking services is they require reasonably significant effort and time to get started.  In the case of Ryze, they have a clunky user 'home' page that you have to take time to fill out. Tribe is a bit easier then Ryze. LinkedIn is relatively easy if you have a resume handy. Friendster is the easiest to fill out (provided you already have a decent picture) and relatively easy to find friends.

<p>A second barrier of entry is that it often takes at least one person with a large existing network before many of the features of the service start being useful. In my case with Ryze and Tribe.Net it was <a href=http://www.henshall.com/blog/>Stuart Henshall</a>, and with LinkedIn it was <a href=http://www.loftesness.com/radio/>Scott Loftesness</a>. With LinkedIn, this was particularly important, as you can't even search for people who you don't have 3rd degree connection with an existing friend -- once I added in Scott I could find lots of people that were on my other networks.</p>

<p>The third barrier of entry is signing up people to your network:</p>

<p>The easiest signups are those that already members of the network. Each of the 4 services have different advantage and disadvantages for signing up existing members of the network:<br>
</p><li>Ryze search allows you to search all members, not just friends of friends. The search is fairly simple, just first name and last name, but you must do them all individually. You get a result which is a very small photo and first and last initial -- in some cases it can be difficult to figure out if it isn't a false-positive, but in most cases it is enough that you can tell. However, when you request to add someone you don't get an opportunity to include in the request message <b>who</b> you are and <b>why</b> you wanted them to join your network.<br>
<li>Tribe.Net also allows you to search by first and last name, and it will search all members, not just friends of friends. Like Ryze you must search individually. However, it does allow you to personalize your request to join.<br>
<li>LinkedIn has a nice feature where you can upload your Outlook address book, and it can find matches of people where the name and email address match and you can ask to invite them. However, once you've exhausted these immediate connections, LinkedIn is harder to add new connections to existing members. First, you must have at least found one person in your Outlook address book who is well connected, or your searches will fail as searches only work through friends of friends. Next, when you find other people, you must enter their email address, and if you don't have it (or can't find it on the net) or if it is different, then you must request an invite by way of that friend of a friend. Of course, you don't want to bother your friends with these requests, so often you will not do so.<br>
<li>Friendster allows you to search by first and last name from the entire network, however, the searches can sometimes be extremely slow. Like Ryze, you can't put a note in to say who and why you want to link to them.<p></p>

<p>The hardest signups are to those who are part of your real-life personal network, but haven't signed up for any of these services. First, you risk being perceived as a spammer if you don't invite each with a personally crafted invitation, and if they do sign up, you feel an obligation to get them going because otherwise their use of the service will be clunky. All of this means that I have invited very few people to join these services that were not already signed up.</p>

<p>Lastly, a big barrier is that all four of these services rely on endorsements of one nature or another. This takes time, and involves some emotional and personal exposure. A poorly written endorsement reflects on both you and the person you are endorsing. Asking for endorsements is an expenditure of personal relationship capital that you need to be careful of. Related, do you endorse people who have endorsed you?</p>

<h3>Barriers of Maintenance</h3>
One you have joined one of these services, you really need to maintain it. This means updating and improving your personal pages, searching for people that have joined and adding them to your friends lists.

<p>One odd ongoing problem that I have is, upon receiving a request, evaluating who I should allow to be a 'friend' -- if I discriminate too much my network will be small. I was much less discriminating when I first joined Ryze, and there are a few people that are on my 'friends' list that I really don't know. Part of this problem is the nature of these links. My ideal would be that there were at least two levels, acquantaince and friend.</p>

<h3>Barriers of Usefuless</h3>
With all the effort it takes to join and start these services, as well as the ongoing effort it takes to maintain them, ultimately there has to be a payoff in some utility. This can be in new friends or contacts, or new business, etc.

<p>At this point I'm not sure that for me that it will be worth the effort. Maybe that is because I'm fairly good at networking to start with, and secondarily because I don't want to overspend my personal relationship capital on frivolous stuff. Maybe if I didn't live in the bay area where many of my contacts are already based, or if I had some more immediate needs, such as looking for a VC to pitch to on LInkedIn, or to party with Ryze members, or to invite people to join an intentional community on Tribe.</p>

<p>Another part of the problem is that there are a number of these sites, and they seem to have a lot of the same people. Maintaining more then one and synchronizing your contacts across multiple services is very difficult. If there was one site that everyone was on and offered the best of all the features, I'd consider dropping all the others.</p>

<p>Related, if everyone doesn't discriminate who they choose as friends, the functionality of these sites may break down, or just become popularity contets.</p>

<h2>The Perfect Social Networking Service</h2>
My ideal service would have the the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affilations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryse, but less clunky.

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I've been interested for several years in the ability of "player-generated content" to create niche or small multiplayer online games, at a company I've invested in called <a href=http://www.skotos.net>Skotos </a>. At this point its oldest game Castle Marrach is completely run by the players, and 7 more games are being developed by their customers. The company is at break-even, but is not yet a 'commercial success'. There are some learnings from the world of massively multiplayer online games that apply to other kinds of social networks.</p>

<p>Some of these learnings have to do with size of groups -- different sizes of teams and groups in games can have very different effects, both positive and negative. I've never seen any Social Software that innately understands that a team of 7 behaves very different then a clan of 50 or a megaclan/tribe of 350. These behaviors have parallels to size of mailing lists, online communities, and even to the size of corporations. If Social Software can integrate an understanding of this then it might be significantly more successful</p>

<p>I'm also interested in what I call "social games" for online games. I don't believe that current MMPORGs serve well what the industry calls the 'socializer', which consists of 15% of current gamer population, but may in fact be much higher if you include women who don't currently play as many online games. Two recent articles that I've been collaborating with Shannon Appelcline on this topic:<br>
</p><li><a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_136.phtml>Social Gaming Interactions, Part One: A History of Form</a><br>
<li><a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_137.phtml>Social Gaming Interactions, Part Two: Competition</a><br>
<li>Part three isn't available until next Thursday, but is on non-competitive social interactions.<p></p>
