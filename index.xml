&lt;h1 id=&#34;smarter-signatures-experiments-in-verifications&#34;&gt;Smarter Signatures: Experiments in Verifications&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Christopher Allen &amp;amp; Shannon Appelcline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A White Paper from Rebooting the Web of Trust II: The ID2020 Designshop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies like the Web of Trust and PKI lay the foundation for &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; on the internet: they map a human persona to a cryptographic construct that is represented by a public key and protected by a private key. &lt;em&gt;Digital signatures&lt;/em&gt; are fundamental to these digital identities and have been widely used in a variety of applications. They’re the heart of SSH, the foundation of certificates, and even the core of newer technologies like blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, today’s simplistic signatures are just the start; they can be improved, to create more powerful and more complex signatures that can truly be better and &lt;em&gt;smarter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to begin experimenting with these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-overview-of-signatures&#34;&gt;An Overview of Signatures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional usage of digital signatures is quite straightforward. The owner of a cryptographic identity signs a message (or a certificate) with his private key; a recipient can then use the related public key to verify the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is one of the few technologies that offers something more: multisignatures. Transactions can be signed by up to N different people, of whom M are required; for example a 2 of 3 multi-sig would require two people from a group of three to sign a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Bitcoin multi-sigs are just a first step. Even if the simple signatures of the modern day were expanded to include multisignatures of any size, they still wouldn’t support the full richness of business and computer logic that is becoming a part of our digital life. Simple signatures can’t offer the flexibility that is required for modern enterprises, and they can’t offer the reliability that is required for modern finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support these needs requires a new kind of signature — a &lt;em&gt;smarter signature&lt;/em&gt; that increases options while still meeting the responsibilities of a robust and trusted signature system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-uses-of-smart-signatures&#34;&gt;The Uses of Smart Signatures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core use of signatures is &lt;em&gt;verification&lt;/em&gt;: they must ensure that the authorization conditions required for a task are met. In the world of simple signatures, that meant verifying that the right person signed a message. However smart signatures have a wider scope, supporting many more use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples follow. They should be considered a starting point, enumerating some of the needs for smart signatures, without being a be-all or end-all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multifactor Expressions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A smart signature should support the inclusion of multiple elements within a single signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multisignature Expressions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A smart signature should support the inclusion of multiple signatures via a logical AND operator. They signatures would &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; be required for verification, forming an N of N multisignature, such as joint homeowners who all need to sign over a deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multisignature Subsets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A smart signature should also support M of N multisignatures where only &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; signatures are required for verification, such as a married couple, either of whom can write checks from a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multisignature Equivalents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A smart signature should support the inclusion of multiple signatures via a logical OR operator, such as when a legacy RSA signature, a current EC signatures, and a future-proof Hash Signature that is quantum resistant but very slow are all included and any of them can be used to verify the signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Varied Content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A smart signature should support the inclusion and combination of a variety of different signature elements, including other verification elements like biometric signatures and proof of hardware control, such as a lead developer who requires both his signature and a hardware token to sign off on software releases. It should also support the inclusion of elements helpful to enable delegation and other signature uses, such as timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Signature Delegation*.&lt;/strong&gt; A key holder should be able to precisely control how his key and his signature are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time-Limited Delegation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A key holder should be able to authorize a person or a device to sign for a limited time, such as when the key holder is on vacation or at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time-Expired Delegation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A key holder should be able to automatically authorize a person or a device if their own use of a key goes inactive for an extended amount of time, such as when a key holder dies, and their successor needs to take over signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use-Limited Delegation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A key holder should be able to authorize a person to sign only in limited situations, such as a software team that can sign a development version of software, but not a stable version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content-Limited Delegation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A key holder should be able to authorize a person to sign messages with specific content, such as a financial department that can sign to issue bonds with a maximum amount and a bounded interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-Signature Delegation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A key holder should be able to authorize a person to use a key in certain instances, such as to revoke a key or to revoke a previously signed certificate, but not to sign documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal Depth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A smart signature should support internal depth by combining these different possibilities, such as a development release of software that includes both multifactoring and delegation by requiring 3-of-5 signatures, where one signer has authorized his assistant because he’s on leave, and another signer requires 2-of-2 keys for his signature, one of which is stored on a hardware token. Because this depth is created through internal links, the requirements are all evaluated synchronously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transactional Support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A smart signature &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; should support external depth by being able to prove that specific states have been reached in a larger state machine through the chaining of multiple signatures, such as when an art dealer needs to examine the transactional history of a painting to ensure that he’s not purchasing stolen goods. Because this depth is created through external links, the requirements tend to be evaluated asynchronously: one smart signature at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These use cases all focus on the &lt;em&gt;creation&lt;/em&gt; of signatures, providing functionality that signers need. However, there are actually two users for any signature: the signer and the verifier. Additional verifier-focused use cases may illuminate UI and UX requirements for a smart signature system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these use cases obviously will require some calculation. However, smart signatures are ultimately about verification, not computation. In fact, our suggested requirements for smart signatures do their best to minimize computation as a factor for any verifying user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-requirements-of-smart-signatures&#34;&gt;The Requirements of Smart Signatures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because smart signatures offer increased complexity over simple signatures, care must be taken to ensure that the complexity does not overpower the security of either the signatures or the systems that they’re running upon. To ensure this, we list six suggested requirements that must be met by smart signature systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Composable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The increased complexity of smart signatures requires that they be built using some sort of programming language. However, the language itself must remain simple, with complexity built up from a constrained set of operations. This ensures the security of the signature language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspectable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Signatures must be easily understandable by a qualified programmer, so that any sophisticated user can readily evaluate the elements of a signature and how they will be verified. This requirement often emerges naturally from composability; it ensures the security of the signatures, with a focus on human-driven security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Signatures must be formally analyzable, so that they can support logical reasoning and so that sophisticated users and expert computer tools can have foreknowledge of the requirements of verification. This further supports the security of the signatures and also foreshadows support for the security and stability of the computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deterministic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Signatures must always produce the same results, even when run on different machines or different operating systems. This also ensures the security of the signatures, but it focuses on machine-driven security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bounded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Signatures must not be able to exceed appropriate CPU or memory limitations through creation of malicious (or bad) signings. Additionally, enforcement of these limitations must be deterministic. This also ensures the security of the computer system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Efficient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Though we place no requirements on the difficulty of creating signatures, the cost of verifying them should be very low. This also ensures the stability of the computer system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A smart signature system that supports the use cases described above and that meets the requirements listed here would add powerful tools to the digital world by meeting the needs of the financial and business worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;experimenting-with-smart-signatures&#34;&gt;Experimenting with Smart Signatures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fulfilling these uses and meeting these requirements of smart signatures necessitates the creation of better languages and better tools. However, this creation of a new foundation for smart signatures (and eventually smarter contracts) can be tricky and full of pitfalls, as shown by the recent problems plaguing The DAO on Ethereum, where flaws in a contract’s code led to the theft of tens of millions of dollars[1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ethereum crisis clearly shows that the design of new languages for smart signature systems must be thorough and comprehensive. We must experiment with many options, to ultimately produce something that is stable and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few different possibilities are discussed below. They should be considered starting points, not ending points. They are not being offered as standards, nor even as the preferred options for smart signature systems. They are instead offered for discussion and for expansion, in the hope that they will eventually lead the way to a more robust smart signature system and the beginning of a more robust web of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-languages-of-smart-signatures&#34;&gt;The Languages of Smart Signatures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming languages are our preferred choice for creating smart signatures because they meet three of the suggested requirements: they’re composable, they’re provable, and they’re deterministic. The composability and provability emerge from the fact that functional programming languages are built of pure mathematical functions; it’s easy to put them together to create more complex systems and it’s easy to prove what they do. The determinism emerges from the fact that functional programming languages do not support state or mutable data; they guarantee that the same inputs will always produce the same outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few options for functional languages. Lambda calculus languages are the classic choice, but the Forth-like Bitcoin Script with its stack-driven functionality offers another possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiment-1-bitcoin-script&#34;&gt;Experiment #1: Bitcoin Script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option for building a new smart signature system is to start with something that already exists and that is already being used to safeguard millions of dollars worth of transactions: Bitcoin Script[2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin Script currently authorizes the spending of Bitcoins. Typically, each Script is linked to either a single signature or else to a M-of-N multi-sig. However, it’s also possible to encode more complex redemption conditions into a Bitcoin Script, and even to keep them secret — allowing a recipient to prove that he met the signing conditions by matching a hash of those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Bitcoin Script is currently used on the blockchain, this is not a requirement. The robust signing language could be used outside of the blockchain — protecting other sorts of authorization systems and creating a generalized smart signature language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Bitcoin Script is constrained, the following example shows that it’s nonetheless a robust functional language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &amp;lt;pubKeyHash&amp;gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple script checks a signature against a public key in order to verify the signature. Much more complexity is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The biggest advantage of the Bitcoin Script approach is that it’s &lt;em&gt;well-tested&lt;/em&gt;. It’s been in use for almost a decade with a focus on authorization, which means that it’s already laid the groundwork for a smart signature system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also &lt;em&gt;well-trusted&lt;/em&gt;. Bitcoin Script is the heart of the Bitcoin system, making it the ultimate guardian of a $10 billion market cap. It’s a language that has proven its financial responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s &lt;em&gt;constrained&lt;/em&gt;. Though Bitcoin Script contains an extensive menu of operations (opcodes), they’ve been curated: some opcodes were disabled in Bitcoin’s early days to prevent mischief. Because of these constraints, the individual elements of a Bitcoin Script can be examined in isolation, making it easy to see any problems. That’s much of what’s maintained the trust in Bitcoin Script and ensured that there were no DAO-style crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The advantageous constraints of Bitcoin Script may also create one of its biggest disadvantages: it’s &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, Bitcoin Script may be too limited to offer the full menu of options required for smart signatures. However, there are already Bitcoin Improvement Proposals in place to increase the set of Bitcoin Script opcodes[3] [4], while Bitcoin’s new segregated witness (segwit) support will make future changes to Bitcoin Script even easier[5]. Blockstream’s sidechains[6] offer an alternative: incorporating new operations without changing the original Bitcoin blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing Bitcoin Script entirely from the blockchain offers another way to enable language updates, but it also raises another issue: Bitcoin Script is currently &lt;em&gt;locked to blockchains.&lt;/em&gt; Though it may be possible to use it independently, this has not been tested and may raise future issues of compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Bitcoin Script is a Forth-derived language, which means that it is &lt;em&gt;stack-oriented.&lt;/em&gt; This requires a particular type of logic that may make it harder for some people to parse or understand — though this may also be the case for fully functional languages like lambda calculuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiment-2-dex&#34;&gt;Experiment #2: Dex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Todd is working on another possible system for smart signatures, one that he calls Dex, a system of deterministic predicate expressions[7]. Much as in Bitcoin Script, Dex’s predicate expressions evaluate simply to either true or false results. However, the other part of Dex’s name is just as important: it’s deterministic, guaranteed to always return the same result for a specific signature and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dex also more fully embraces functional programming: it’s built using lambda calculus. As with Lisp, atoms of numbers, strings, symbols, and cells are recursively built up into s-expressions. (In other words, Dex contains parenthesized lists that regularize and order the evaluation of functions.) These s-expressions are then merkelized (hashed), producing unique digests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dex expressions should look quite familiar to Lisp programmers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(sig_valid &amp;lt;pubkey&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sig&amp;gt; &amp;lt;hash&amp;gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function might be accessed with a lambda function like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(sig_valid &amp;lt;pubkey&amp;gt; (cdr argm) (sha256 (car argm)))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which allows a message and its signature to be passed into the sig_valid function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(sig_valid &amp;lt;pubkey&amp;gt; (cdr &amp;lsquo;(&amp;lt;msg&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sig&amp;gt;)) (sha256 (car &amp;lsquo;(&amp;lt;msg&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sig&amp;gt;))))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the cdr, the car, and the sha256 hash are all evaluated, the sig_valid function can then do its job and determine the validity of the signature. Again, much more complexity is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; One of the biggest advantages of Dex is one of its core features, its &lt;em&gt;determinism.&lt;/em&gt; The ability to run code on different computers and get the same results is vital for the consensus of any signature system. With a language like Bitcoin Script, which is not built on an entirely functional language, this sort of determinism was much more difficult to achieve. In Dex, thanks to its basis in lambda calculus, it’s there from the start as an integral feature of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dex also has excellent properties of &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt;. The use of a merkle tree helps Dex to enable pruning: unneeded data in an expression can be cut out and replaced with hash digests, making it easier to use lite clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dex is &lt;em&gt;upwardly mobile.&lt;/em&gt; smart signatures can be building blocks for creating full smart contract systems, and this is an option that Todd has considering from the start. He even calls Dex one of the “Building Blocks of the State Machine Approach to Consensus”, with its deterministic expressions being states in the state machine[8].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Lambda Calculus is generally an &lt;em&gt;unusual&lt;/em&gt; sort of programming language. It doesn’t have the same coding styles or the same programming patterns as more common, imperative languages. This is what enables many of its desired features, but it can also prove a disadvantage to some programmers. Further, languages like Common Lisp and Scheme have long been used in entry-level college computer classes, which may create cognitive biases in some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to a well-tested language like Bitcoin Script, Dex is quite &lt;em&gt;novel.&lt;/em&gt; It’s not just untested, it’s truly experimental. Though there’s great potential for its expansion, it will have to be thoroughly examined before it can reach that potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-security-of-signatures&#34;&gt;The Security of Signatures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Ethereum crisis showed us, smart signatures and smart contracts won’t be secure until their programming languages are secured and protected against errors. Resolving this problem is just as important as laying the foundations of a smart signature language. Fortunately, a number of people have been tackling this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Pettersson and Robert Edström of the Chalmers University of Technology have written a thesis on making smart contracts safer[9]. Their approach focuses on Idris, a functional programming language with lambda binding. If uses an advanced type system to offer solutions for several classes of common errors and even provides a backend for Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the SecLang taskforce[10] focuses on security in programming languages. They have been writing papers for decades that analyze security, improve privacy, and remove vulnerabilities. Their approaches could be vital to enabling that same security in smart contract languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Chalmers and SecLang point us toward options for safety and security in smart signatures languages of all sorts; there are doubtless other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-questions&#34;&gt;Open Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to create and secure a new language for smart signatures is just the first step. There are many other open questions, some of which were raised in an earlier Rebooting the Web of Trust paper[11].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Though functional languages are stateless, they still require contexts: how do they receive input? Bitcoin provides context through the output script of a previous transaction. Other online tools have internal contexts, external contexts, or run contexts. However, there’s nothing parallel for smart signatures. What contexts are required, and how should they be implemented?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revocation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How do we allow signers to revoke a signature? Do we need to separate out proof of validation and proof of non-revocation in a script? Is it even possible to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; non-revocation? Alternatively, should we severely limit the lifespan of signatures to avoid the question of revocation entirely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hierarchical Deterministic Keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Some use cases, such as short-term delegation, could benefit from Hierarchical Deterministic Keys (HDKs), where children key can be created from a parent key. How can these HDKs be incorporated into smart signatures and how can they be secured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A third-party oracle can help with the evaluation of certain conditions such as proof-of-existence and perhaps even proof-of-non-revocation. However, oracles may also be what separates smart signatures from more complex smart contracts. Does a simple subset of oracles have any place in the world of smart signatures? If so, what’s the actual dividing line between a smart signature and a smart contract?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is meant to be an icebreaker. Though it offers some suggested smart signature use cases and requirements, they’re evolutionary. They were incorporated in part from the Rebooting the Web of Trust I “Smart Signatures” (2015) paper and in part from Peter Todd’s “Dex: Deterministic Predicate Expressions for Smarter Signatures” (2016) paper, then they were expanded and reorganized for this paper. In other words, they’re works in progress that could still benefit from additional input. Similarly, the experiments overviewed in this paper are just two of many. We welcome more possibilities and more discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart signatures are an important tool that could change the way business is done on the internet; they could revamp how we live and even play in electronic communities. As a result, it’s critical that we get them right, that we not repeat the mistakes of The Dao and other sophisticated computer systems that went before us, but which didn’t live up to the rigors of actual usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we offer this paper as the beginning of a conversation about how to create &lt;em&gt;smarter&lt;/em&gt; signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you suggest?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c848c7a7970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Identity-510866&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c848c7a7970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c848c7a7970b-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Identity-510866&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today I head out to a month-long series of events associated with identity: I’m starting with the 22st (!) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/&#34;&gt;Internet Identity Workshop&lt;/a&gt; next week; then I’m speaking at the blockchain conference &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2016/&#34;&gt;Consensus&lt;/a&gt; about identity; next I am part of the team putting together the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://id2020summit.org/&#34;&gt;ID2020 Summit&lt;/a&gt; on Digital Identity at the United Nations; and finally I&amp;#39;m hosting the second &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weboftrust.info/&#34;&gt;#RebootingWebOfTrust&lt;/a&gt; design workshop on decentralized identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At all of these events I want to share a vision for how we can enhance the ability of digital identity to enable trust while preserving individual privacy. This vision is what I call “Self-Sovereign Identity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need this vision now? Governments and companies are sharing an unprecedented amount of information, cross-correlating everything from viewing habits to purchases, to where people are located during the day, to where they sleep at night, and with whom they associate. In addition, as the Third World enters the computer age, digital citizenship is providing Third World residents with greater access to human rights and to the global economy. When properly designed and implemented, self-sovereign identity can offer these benefits while also protecting individuals from the ever-increasing control of those in power, who may not have the best interests of the individual at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what exactly do I mean by “Self-Sovereign Identity”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;You Can’t Spell Identity without an “I”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity is a uniquely human concept. It is that ineffable “I” of self-consciousness, something that is understood worldwide by every person living in every culture. As René Descartes said, &lt;em&gt;Cogito ergo sum&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;I think, therefore I am&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, modern society has muddled this concept of identity. Today, nations and corporations conflate driver’s licenses, social security cards, and other state-issued credentials with identity; this is problematic because it suggests a person can lose his very identity if a state revokes his credentials or even if he just crosses state borders. &lt;strong&gt;I think, but I am not&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity in the digital world is even trickier. It suffers from the same problem of centralized control, but it’s simultaneously very balkanized: identities are piecemeal, differing from one Internet domain to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the digital world becomes increasingly important to the physical world, it also presents a new opportunity; it offers the possibility of redefining modern concepts of identity. It might allow us to place identity back under our control —&amp;#0160;once more reuniting identity with the ineffable “I”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, this redefinition of identity has begun to have a new name: &lt;em&gt;self-sovereign identity&lt;/em&gt;. However, in order to understand this term, we need to review some history of identity technology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Evolution of Identity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models for online identity have advanced through four broad stages since the advent of the Internet: centralized identity, federated identity, user-centric identity, and self-sovereign identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Phase One: Centralized Identity &lt;em&gt;(administrative control by a single authority or hierarchy)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Internet’s early days, &lt;em&gt;centralized authorities&lt;/em&gt; became the issuers and authenticators of digital identity. Organizations like IANA (1988) determined the validity of IP addresses and ICANN (1998) arbitrated domain names. Then, beginning in 1995, certificate authorities (CAs) stepped up to help Internet commerce sites prove they were who they said they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these organizations took a small step beyond centralization and created &lt;em&gt;hierarchies&lt;/em&gt;. A root controller could annoint other organizations to each oversee their own heirarchy. However, the root still had the core power — they were just creating new, less powerful centralizations beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, granting control of digital identity to centralized authorities of the online world suffers from the same problems caused by the state authorities of the physical world: users are locked in to a single authority who can deny their identity or even confirm a false identity. Centralization innately gives power to the centralized entities, not to the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Internet grew, as power accumulated across hierarchies, a further problem was revealed: identities were increasingly balkanized. They multiplied as web sites did, forcing users to juggle dozens of identities on dozens of different sites — while having control over none of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, identity on the Internet today is still centralized — or at best, hierarchical. Digital identities are owned by CAs, domain registrars, and individual sites, and then rented to users or revoked at any time. However, for the last two decades there’s also been a growing push to return identities to the people, so that they actually could control them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interlude: Foreshadowing the Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PGP (1991) offered one of the first hints toward what could become self-sovereign identity. It introduced the &amp;#39;Web of Trust&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-11&#34; name=&#34;ref-11&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which established trust for a digital identity by allowing peers to act as introducers and validators of public keys&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-22&#34; name=&#34;ref-22&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Anyone could be validator in the PGP model. The result was a powerful example of decentralized trust management, but it focused on email addresses, which meant that it still depended on centralized hierarchies. For a variety of reasons, PGP never became broadly adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other early thoughts appeared in “Establishing Identity without Certification Authority” (1996), a paper by Carl Ellison that examined how digital identity was created&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-33&#34; name=&#34;ref-33&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He considered both authorities such as Certificate Authorities and peer-to-peer systems like PGP as options for defining digital identity. He then settled on a method for verifying online identity by exchanging shared secrets over a secure channel. This allowed users to control their own identity without depending on a managing authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellison was also at the heart of the SPKI/SDSI project (1999) &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-44&#34; name=&#34;ref-44&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-55&#34; name=&#34;ref-55&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Its goal was to build a simpler public infrastructure for identity certificates that could replace the complicated X.509 system. Although centralized authorities were considered as an option, they were not the only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beginning, but an even more revolutionary reconception of identity in the 21st century would be required to truly bring self-sovereignty to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Phase Two: Federated Identity &lt;em&gt;(administrative control by multiple, federated authorities)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next major advancement for digital identity occurred at the turn of the century when a variety of commercial organizations moved beyond hierarchy to debalkanize online identity in a new manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Passport (1999) initiative was one of the first. It imagined &lt;em&gt;federated identity&lt;/em&gt;, which allowed users to utilize the same identity on multiple sites. However, it put Microsoft at the center of the federation, which made it almost as centralized as traditional authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response Sun Microsoft organized the Liberty Alliance (2001). They resisted the idea of centralized authority, instead creating a &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; federation, but the result was instaed an oligarchy: the power of centralized authority was now divided among several powerful entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federation improved on the problem of balkanization: users could wander from site to site under the system. However, each individual site remained an authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Phase Three: User-Centric Identity &lt;em&gt;(individual&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;administrative control across multiple authorities without requiring a federation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Augmented Social Network (2000) laid the groundwork for a new sort of digital identity in their proposal for the creation of a next-generation Internet. In an extensive white paper&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-66&#34; name=&#34;ref-66&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, they suggested building “persistent online identity” into the very architecture of the Internet. From the viewpoint of self-sovereign identity, their most important advance was “the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity”. The ASN group felt that Passport and the Liberty Alliance could not meet these goals because the “business-based initiatives” put too much emphasis on the privatization of information and the modeling of users as consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ASN ideas would become the foundation of much that followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Identity Commons (2001-Present) began to consolidate the new work on digital identity with a focus on decentralization. Their most important contribution may have been the creation, in association with the Identity Gang, of the Internet Identity Workshop (2005-Present) working group. For the last ten years, the IIW has advanced the idea of decentralized identity in a series of semi-yearly meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IIW community focused on a new term that countered the server-centric model of centralized authorities: &lt;em&gt;user-centric identity&lt;/em&gt;. The term suggests that users are placed in the middle of the identity process. Initial discussions of the topic focused on creating a better user experience&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-77&#34; name=&#34;ref-77&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which underlined the need to put users front and center in the quest for online identity. However the definition of a user-centric identity soon expanded to include the desire for a user to have more control over his identity and for trust to be decentralized&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-88&#34; name=&#34;ref-88&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the IIW has supported many new methods for creating digital identity, including OpenID (2005), OpenID 2.0 (2006), OpenID Connect (2014), OAuth (2010), and FIDO (2013). As implemented, user-centric methodologies tend to focus on two elements: user consent and interoperability. By adopting them, a user can decide to share an identity from one service to another and thus debalkanize his digital self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user-centric identity communities had even more ambitious visions; they intended to give users complete control of their digital identities. Unfortunately, powerful institutions co-opted their efforts and kept them from fully realizing their goals. Much as with the Liberty Alliance, final ownership of user-centric identities today remain with the entities that register them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenID offers an example. A user can theoretically register his own OpenID, which he can then use autonomously. However, this takes some technical know-how, so the casual Internet user is more likely to use an OpenID from one public web site as a login for another. If the user selects a site that is long-lived and trustworthy, he can gain many of the advantages of a self-sovereign identity — but it could be taken away at any time by the registering entity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Connect (2008) appeared a few years after OpenID, leveraging lessons learned, and thus was several times more successful largely due to a better user interface&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-99&#34; name=&#34;ref-99&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unfortunately, Facebook Connect veers even further from the original user-centric ideal of user control. To start with, there’s no choice of provider; it’s Facebook. Worse, Facebook has a history of arbitrarily closing accounts, as was seen in their recent real-name controversy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1010&#34; name=&#34;ref-1010&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, people who access other sites with their “user-centric” Facebook Connect identity may be even more vulnerable than OpenID users to losing that identity in multiple places at one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s central authorities all over again. Worse, it’s like state-controlled authentication of identity, except with a self-elected “rogue” state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: being user-centric isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Phase Four: Self-Sovereign Identity &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(individual control across any number of authorities)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User-centric designs turned centralized identities into interoperable federated identities with centralized control, while also respecting some level of user consent about how to share an identity (and with whom). It was an important step toward true user control of identity, but just a step. To take the next step required user autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of &lt;em&gt;self-sovereign identity&lt;/em&gt;, a term that’s coming into increased use in the ‘10s. Rather than just advocating that users be at the center of the identity process, self-sovereign identity requires that users be the rulers of their own identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first references to identity sovereignty occurred in February 2012, when developer Moxie Marlinspike wrote about “Sovereign Source Authority”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1111&#34; name=&#34;ref-1111&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He said that individuals “have an established Right to an ‘identity’”, but that national registration destroys that sovereignty. Some ideas are in the air, so it’s no surprise that almost simultaneously, in March 2012, Patrick Deegan began work on Open Mustard Seed, an open-source framework that gives users control of their digital identity and their data in decentralized systems&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1212&#34; name=&#34;ref-1212&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was one of several &amp;quot;personal cloud&amp;quot; initiatives that appeared around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the idea of self-sovereign identity has proliferated. Marlinspike has blogged how the term has evolved&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1313&#34; name=&#34;ref-1313&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As a developer, he shows one way to address self-sovereign identity: as a &lt;em&gt;mathematical policy&lt;/em&gt;, where cryptography is used to protect a user’s autonomy and control. However, that’s not the only model. Respect Network instead addresses self-sovereign identity as a &lt;em&gt;legal policy&lt;/em&gt;; they define contractual rules and principles that members of their network agree to follow&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1414&#34; name=&#34;ref-1414&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Windhover Principles For Digital Identity, Trust and Data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1515&#34; name=&#34;ref-1515&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Everynym’s Identity System Essentials&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1616&#34; name=&#34;ref-1616&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; offer some additional perspectives on the rapid advent of self-sovereign identity since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, self-sovereign identity has also entered the sphere of &lt;em&gt;international policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1717&#34; name=&#34;ref-1717&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This has largely been driven by the refugee crisis that has beset Europe, which has resulted in many people lacking a recognized identity due to their flight from the state that issued their credentials. However, it’s a long-standing international problem, as foreign workers have often been abused by the countries they work in due to the lack of state-issued credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If self-sovereign identity was becoming relevant a few years ago, in light of current international crises its importance has skyrocketed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time to move toward self-sovereign identity is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A Definition of Self-Sovereign Identity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, what is self-sovereign identity exactly? The truth is that there’s no consensus. As much as anything, this article is intended to begin a dialogue on that topic. However, I wish to offer a starting position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-sovereign identity is the next step beyond user-centric identity and that means it begins at the same place: the user must be central to the administration of identity. That requires not just the interoperability of a user’s identity across multiple locations, with the user’s consent, but also true user control of that digital identity, creating user autonomy. To accomplish this, a self-sovereign identity must be transportable; it can’t be locked down to one site or locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A self-sovereign identity must also allow ordinary users to make claims, which could include personally identifying information or facts about personal capability or group membership&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1818&#34; name=&#34;ref-1818&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It can even contain information about the user that was asserted by other persons or groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the creation of a self-sovereign identity, we must be careful to protect the individual. A self-sovereign identity must defend against financial and other losses, prevent human rights abuses by the powerful, and support the rights of the individual to be oneself and to freely associate&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-1919&#34; name=&#34;ref-1919&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a lot more to self-sovereign identity than just this brief summation. Any self-sovereign identity must also meet a series of guiding principles — and these principles actually provide a better, more comprehensive, definition of what self-sovereign identity is. A proposal for them follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of different people have written about the principles of identity. Kim Cameron wrote one of the earliest “Laws of Identity”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-2020&#34; name=&#34;ref-2020&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, while the aforementioned Respect Network policy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-2121&#34; name=&#34;ref-2121&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and W3C Verifiable Claims Task Force FAQ&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-2222&#34; name=&#34;ref-2222&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; offer additional perspectives on digital identity. This section draws on all of these ideas to create a group of principles specific to self-sovereign identity. As with the definition itself, consider these principles a departure point to provoke a discussion about what’s truly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles attempt to ensure the user control that’s at the heart of self-sovereign identity. However, they also recognize that identity can be a double-edged sword — usable for both beneficial and maleficent purposes. Thus, an identity system must balance transparency, fairness, and support of the commons with protection for the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existence.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Users must have an independent existence.&lt;/em&gt; Any self-sovereign identity is ultimately based on the ineffable “I” that’s at the heart of identity. It can never exist wholly in digital form. This must be the kernel of self that is upheld and supported. A self-sovereign identity simply makes public and accessible some limited aspects of the “I” that already exists.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Users must control their identities.&lt;/em&gt; Subject to well-understood and secure algorithms that ensure the continued validity of an identity and its claims, the user is the ultimate authority on their identity. They should always be able to refer to it, update it, or even hide it. They must be able to choose celebrity or privacy as they prefer. This doesn’t mean that a user controls all of the claims on their identity: other users may make claims about a user, but they should not be central to the identity itself.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Users must have access to their own data.&lt;/em&gt; A user must always be able to easily retrieve all the claims and other data within his identity. There must be no hidden data and no gatekeepers. This does not mean that a user can necessarily modify all the claims associated with his identity, but it does mean they should be aware of them. It also does not mean that users have equal access to others’ data, only to their own.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Systems and algorithms must be transparent.&lt;/em&gt; The systems used to administer and operate a network of identities must be open, both in how they function and in how they are managed and updated. The algorithms should be free, open-source, well-known, and as independent as possible of any particular architecture; anyone should be able to examine how they work.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Identities must be long-lived.&lt;/em&gt; Preferably, identities should last forever, or at least for as long as the user wishes. Though private keys might need to be rotated and data might need to be changed, the identity remains. In the fast-moving world of the Internet, this goal may not be entirely reasonable, so at the least identities should last until they’ve been outdated by newer identity systems. This must not contradict a “right to be forgotten”; a user should be able to dispose of an identity if he wishes and claims should be modified or removed as appropriate over time. To do this requires a firm separation between an identity and its claims:&amp;#0160;they can&amp;#39;t be tied forever.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Information and services about identity must be transportable.&lt;/em&gt; Identities must not be held by a singular third-party entity, even if it&amp;#39;s a trusted entity that is expected to work in the best interest of the user. The problem is that entities can disappear — and on the Internet, most eventually do. Regimes may change, users may move to different jurisdictions. Transportable identities ensure that the user remains in control of his identity no matter what, and can also improve an identity’s persistence over time.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Identities should be as widely usable as possible.&lt;/em&gt; Identities are of little value if they only work in limited niches. The goal of a 21st-century digital identity system is to make identity information widely available, crossing international boundaries to create global identities, without losing user control. Thanks to persistence and autonomy these widely available identities can then become continually available.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consent.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Users must agree to the use of their identity.&lt;/em&gt; Any identity system is built around sharing that identity and its claims, and an interoperable system increases the amount of sharing that occurs. However, sharing of data must only occur with the consent of the user. Though other users such as an employer, a credit bureau, or a friend might present claims, the user must still offer consent for them to become valid. Note that this consent might not be interactive, but it must still be deliberate and well-understood.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalization.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Disclosure of claims must be minimized.&lt;/em&gt; When data is disclosed, that disclosure should involve the minimum amount of data necessary to accomplish the task at hand. For example, if only a minimum age is called for, then the exact age should not be disclosed, and if only an age is requested, then the more precise date of birth should not be disclosed. This principle can be supported with selective disclosure, range proofs, and other zero-knowledge techniques, but non-correlatibility is still a very hard (perhaps impossible) task; the best we can do is to use minimalization to support privacy as best as possible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The rights of users must be protected.&lt;/em&gt; When there is a conflict between the needs of the identity network and the rights of individual users, then the network should err on the side of preserving the freedoms and rights of the individuals over the needs of the network. To ensure this, identity authentication must occur through independent algorithms that are censorship-resistant and force-resilient and that are run in a decentralized manner.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seek your assistance in taking these principles to the next level. I will be at the IIW conference this week, at other conferences this month, and in particular I will be meeting with other identity technologists on May 21st and 22nd in NYC after the ID 2020 Summit on Digital Identity. These principles will be placed into &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ChristopherA/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/ThePathToSelf-SovereignIdentity.md&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and we hope to collaborate with all those interested in refining them through the workshop, or through Github &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ChristopherA/self-sovereign-identity/pulls&#34;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt; from the broader community. Come join us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of digital identity has been evolving for a few decades now, from centralized identities to federated identities to user-centric identities to self-sovereign identities. However, even today exactly what a self-sovereign identity is, and what rules it should recognize, aren’t well-known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article seeks to begin a dialogue on that topic, by offering up a definition and a set of principles as a starting point for this new form of user-controlled and persistent identity of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glossary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following terms are relevant to this article. These are just a subset of the terms generally used to discuss digital identity, and have been minimized to avoid unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authority.&lt;/strong&gt; A trusted entity that is able to verify and authenticate identities. Clasically, this was a centralized (or later, federated) entity. Now, this can also be an open and transparent algorithm run in a decentralized manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claim.&lt;/strong&gt; A statement about an identity. This could be: a fact, such as a person&amp;#39;s age; an opinion, such as a rating of their trustworthiness; or something in between, such as an assessment of a skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credential.&lt;/strong&gt; In the identity community this term overlaps with claims. Here it is used instead for the dictionary definition: &amp;quot;entitlement to privileges, or the like, usually in written form&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#dfref-2323&#34; name=&#34;ref-2323&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, credentials refer to the state-issued plastic and paper IDs that grant people access in the modern world. A credential generally incorporates one or more identifiers and numerous claims about a single entity, all authenticated with some sort of digital signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifier.&lt;/strong&gt; A name or other label that uniquely identifies an identity. For simplicity&amp;#39;s sake, this term has been avoided in this article (except in this glossary), but it&amp;#39;s generally important to an understanding of digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity.&lt;/strong&gt; A representation of an entity. It can include claims and identifiers. In this article, the focus is on &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; identity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82f02ac970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Little Men Circle&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82f02ac970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82f02ac970b-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Little Men Circle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As part of being a&amp;#0160;member of the sustainable MBA community at &lt;a href=&#34;http://pinchot.edu/&#34;&gt;Pinchot University&lt;/a&gt;, I have been trying to articulate what I like about the kinds of collaboration that are possible even inside a competitive industry. In our MBA program, we don&amp;#39;t just teach about competitive strategy&amp;#0160;(using classic&amp;#39;s like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/On-Competition-Michael-E-Porter/dp/0875847951&#34;&gt;Porter&amp;#39;s book&lt;/a&gt;), but we also teach about the nature of&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia link to Coopetition&#34;&gt;coopetition&lt;/a&gt;. These practices&amp;#0160;are more&amp;#0160;likely to lead to sustainable businesses (not only sustainable=green, but sustainable=enduring).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a participant during several periods of technology history where coopetition has been practiced, most recently during the early days of the Twitter ecosystem. I can distinctly remember two companies&amp;#0160;offering competitive Twitter clients sharing best practices at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iosdevcamp.org&#34;&gt;iOSDevCamp&lt;/a&gt; hackathon I hosted. Unfortunately these practices ended when Twitter pulled the rug out from independent developers by controlling the API keys under the guise of &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20131017201719/https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience&#34;&gt;Delivering a Consistent Twitter Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#0160;(post now only visible on Internet Archive)&lt;/em&gt;. There are some that argue that Twitter may have ultimately &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novaspivack.com/technology/where-twitter-went-wrong-and-how-to-right-it&#34;&gt;killed its ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of short-term profits over a long-term community of innovators. We have seen this take over elsewhere as described in&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pando.com/2012/11/03/how-ecosystems-became-the-new-walled-gardens/&#34;&gt;How Ecosystems Became the New Walled Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes a great participatory ecosystem? My recent work in trying to understand Elinor Ostrom&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html&#34;&gt;design principles for the collective governance of the commons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and some other thoughts have led me to this definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Participatory Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participatory ecosystem is a business ecosystem with relatively low barriers to economic participation, artistic and professional expression, and civic engagement by all stakeholders, including producers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has strong support for creating, sharing and increasing the production of goods and services of value to the ecosystem. A participatory ecosystem will have system processes where established stakeholders are incentivized to share knowledge, access to markets, and capital to new stakeholders in the ecosystem, and to turn consumers into producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders with leadership positions in a participatory ecosystem may change over time, but the function of an ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions, grow the market, to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participatory system is resilient, and has system processes, such as decentralization, to prevent bad actors. Every stakeholder in a participatory ecosystem believes that their goods and services matter, and feel some degree of social connection and community with one another (at least they care what other people think about what they produce.) Not every stakeholder must produce, but all must believe that they are free to produce when ready and what they contribute will be appropriately valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not completely an original idea&amp;#0160;— it is of&amp;#0160;a mashup of Henry Jenkins’ &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_culture&#34;&gt;“participatory culture”&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;definition&amp;#0160;with&amp;#0160;James Moore’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_ecosystem&#34;&gt;“business ecosystem”&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;ideas. I&amp;#39;ve added a few&amp;#0160;things I&amp;#39;ve observed about&amp;#0160;working participatory ecosystems, and have also&amp;#0160;run this definition&amp;#0160;by a number of my colleagues in a variety of industries for small tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently I&amp;#39;ve been using it in talks about the blockchain ecosystem. I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://blockstream.com/2016/04/05/blockstream-christopher-allen-linux-foundation-w3c-ietf/&#34;&gt;recently joined&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blockstream.com&#34;&gt;Blockstream&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;where I am leading a number of&amp;#0160;strategic initiatives, including the company’s participation in cross-industry collaborations, as well as future technical efforts with international standards organizations such as W3C, IETF, and Oasis. In these efforts I have been sharing this definition more broadly, and it seems to be resonating with the community, in particular as the blockchain community cares deeply about decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted this definition to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.participatoryecosystem.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;hoping that others can fork it and submit pull requests to make it better — just like how&amp;#0160;open source world works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Revised “Ostrom’s Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons”</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 15:23:09 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-250wi&#34; style=&#34;width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The traditional economic definition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the commons”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are those resources that are held in common and not privately owned. This is closely related to economic concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;public goods&lt;/a&gt;, which are goods that are both &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;non-excludable&lt;/a&gt; (in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;non-rivalrous&lt;/a&gt; (where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own personal definition for the commons is broader — any regenerative, self-organizing complex system that can be drawn upon for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artbrock.com/presentations/new-economy-new-wealth&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;deep wealth&lt;/a&gt;. These can include traditional commons, such as lumber, fish, etc., but can also include other regenerative systems such as communities, markets, intellectual property, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Elinor Ostrom&lt;/a&gt; received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her “analysis of economic governance, especially the commons”. In that, she listed 8 principles for effectively managing against the tragedy of the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;ve found her original words — as well as many adaptions I&amp;#39;ve seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there also has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to generalize her principles for broader use given my broader definition of the commons, and apply them to everything from how to manage an online community to how a business should function with competitors. I went to the original version, more contemporary research, as well as a number of modern adaptions to define a new set of design principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/03/10-design-principles-for-governing-the-commons.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;first draft&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;divided up her 8 principles into 10. I then ran this&amp;#0160;list by a number of experts in this field, and here is my second draft based on their feedback. This draft in fact breaks up her principles into 12 different ones, but I have retained her old numbering system as there are large number of works that refer to the original 8. In addition, there appears to be some differences in thoughts on number 8, so I&amp;#39;ve included two variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ostrom’s Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Avoid the Tragedy of the Commons within Self-Organizing Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1A. DEFINE AUTHORIZED USE:&lt;/strong&gt; The community of those who have the right to use the common resource is clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1B. DEFINE COMMONS BOUNDARIES:&lt;/strong&gt; The boundaries of the commons are clearly defined so as to separate the usage rules from the larger environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2A. MAKE COSTS PROPORTIONAL:&lt;/strong&gt; Costs for using and maintaining the commons are proportional to the benefits that those users receive from the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2B. PAY ALL COSTS:&lt;/strong&gt; People that use the commons keep costs inside the local system as much as possible. They do not externalize costs either to neighbors or future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3A. DECIDE INCLUSIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone who benefits from or is affected by the use of the commons makes choices about it. This includes decision-making on resource allocation and on rules and responsibilities for use of the commons. Members of the community operate with respect and mutual regard for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3B. ADAPT LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Members of the community adapt the rules and culture for the commons to local needs, resource qualities and environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4A. SHARE KNOWLEDGE:&lt;/strong&gt; All members are actively engaged in observing and sharing knowledge about the conditions of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4B. MONITOR EFFECTIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; Monitors who are members of (or supported by and accountable to) the community view and report on the use and maintenance of the commons by community members and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. HOLD ACCOUNTABLE:&lt;/strong&gt; Violators of the rules or culture of the commons face graduated sanctions, proportional to the seriousness of the transgression. These are applied by members of the community or by others who are accountable to community for applying such consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. PROMPTLY RESOLVE CONFLICTS:&lt;/strong&gt; The community offers inexpensive, fast and easy access to mediation for effective conflict resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. GOVERN LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Community self-determination is recognized and supported by higher-level authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. CONNECT TO RELATED SYSTEMS:&lt;/strong&gt; Any side effects or other repercussions by one community to another in managing their commons, should be addressed in the context of larger, nested communities that have a legitimate role in those consequences. These externalities should be resolved by the community at the most immediate or local level (aka subsidiarity) that can operate from effective human relationships, rather than by a faceless authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALT 8. COORDINATE WITH RELATED SYSTEMS&lt;/strong&gt;: For groups that are part of larger social systems, there must be appropriate coordination among relevant groups. Every sphere of activity has an optimal scale. Large scale governance requires finding the optimal scale for each sphere of activity and appropriately coordinating the activities, a concept called polycentric governance. A related concept is subsidiarity, which assigns governance tasks by default to the lowest jurisdiction, unless this is explicitly determined to be ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>A Spectrum of Consent</title>
      <link>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2015/09/a-spectrum-of-consent.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 09:28:29 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lifewithalacrity.github.io/2015/09/a-spectrum-of-consent.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Consensus-flowchart&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Consensus-flowchart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have made understanding of consent and consensus, in both their human and technological forms, a major part of my career. I have explored them through my work in cryptographic technologies, but also in human terms at the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://groupworksdeck.org/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Group Pattern Language Project&#34;&gt;Group Pattern Language Project&lt;/a&gt;, by co-authoring with Shannon Appecline forthcoming book on the design of collaborative games, and another book in progress on the patterns of cooperative play. My business management style is also more collaborative and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is so important to me that I named the company I founded in 1988 (that eventually led the effort to establish TLS 1.0 as an internet standard) was named &amp;quot;Consensus Development&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/19980709005818/http://www.consensus.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus&amp;#0160;I&amp;#39;ve been fascinated this week to watch a major online community try to define for itself what “consent” and “consensus” in their community will mean.&amp;#0160;This community in question is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency community, which is faced with a minority of the community attempting to “hard fork”. This weekend they &lt;a href=&#34;https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;meet in Montreal &lt;/a&gt;to attempt to discover another way to return to some form of unanimity and broad consent of their stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of the hardest problems in human interactions. Consent comes from the Latin, meaning “feel together”, which this community now believes they lack. But&amp;#0160;it is particularly poignant that this particular community is facing these questions. Bitcoin is technologically based on a formal protocol that uses a mathematical and cryptographic method for consensus called the “blockchain”. Every 10 minutes, thousands of nodes and hundreds of miners arrive at a consensus on all the bitcoin transactions during that time. Bitcoin, and the larger Blockchain community are the worlds experts on cryptographic forms of consensus. But the human consensus problem is still hard for them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;A Spectrum of Consent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my recent efforts into understanding this topic, and some recent dives into my &amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Systems for Collective Choice (start of series)&#34;&gt;Systems For Collective Choice&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#0160;the topic of the &lt;em&gt;A Spectrum Of Consent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#0160;has repeatedly come up. There appear to be a range of levels of consent required for various deliberative processes and voting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had these incomplete notes on the Spectrum of Consent around for a couple of years, which I&amp;#39;ve only shared privately. However, given my discussions this week at the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Consensus 2015&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;conference and elsewhere, it was time to share. I welcome comments and suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, many groups view consensus processes as a requirement, however, many others see consensus processes as unworkable and a serious problem to be avoided. These efforts to define &lt;em&gt;A Spectrum Of Consent&lt;/em&gt; are somewhat to help me understand this dichotomy. I personally believe that certain deliberative processes and voting systems are good for some things, some for others. But I find I&amp;#39;m rare in that opinion — most people lean strongly in way one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is clearly some conflation and orthogonality in my list below of types of representation (who decides), deliberation (how you approach a decision), and choice selection method (voting system), but I think this is a good start at defining a spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uniform Consensus (or Absolute Agreement)&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where all parties are required support and agree to a decision, without anyone voting to neither agree or disagree (aka abstaining).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unanimous Consent (or Unanimity)&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where all parties support and agree to a decision, however, some parties may abstain by raising no objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus Decision Making&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative process of reaching unanimous consent (everyone agrees or abstains) with a number of procedural rules or cultural norms that limit blocking. Most forms of Consensus Decision Making all members have equal voice in the deliberation and equal vote. Most ask a closing question question such as &amp;quot;Are there any remaining unresolved concerns?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Are there any paramount objections?&amp;quot;. Some believe that in Consensus Decision Making that there is never a “vote”. (Another &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.community4me.com/consensus.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;definition of consensus&lt;/a&gt;) (PDF on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Consensus PDF&#34;&gt;Consensus Process&lt;/a&gt;) and (&lt;a href=&#34;https://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/when-not-to-use-consensus/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;When to not use Consensus&#34;&gt;when to not use consensus&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sense of Meeting&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative deliberative process practice as originally created by the Quakers. It is related to consensus which seeks “unity in the discernment of a decision” It is not necessary for every member to fully agree with a decision, but rather for members “to discern that as a body they are called in a particular direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus Minus One&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where a party may block only if they can find at least one other uninvolved party to agree to join together to block. Otherwise the decision passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus Seeking&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberation process that attempt to reach unanimous consent, but can fall back to a majority vote when required. Essentially Consensus Decision Making in deliberative process — listening to those with objections, but the ability to go to a vote stops the &amp;quot;tyranny of the minority&amp;quot; that sometimes happens with consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediated Consensus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;— Related to Consensus Seeking. An immediate decision can be made by consensus, but if that fails the blockers and proponents have to meet separately with or without a mediator, and if they still don&amp;#39;t agree then its brought back to the next meeting for a vote.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Consensus&amp;#0160;(still seeking right name of this one)&lt;/strong&gt; — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. Consensus is required within each group but not of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consequential Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)&lt;/strong&gt; — Only those affected by the outcome of the decision can participate and vote in the decision, which requires consensus of all those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representative Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)&lt;/strong&gt; — Each party who participates in the deliberation votes represents the interests of others by some rules. Consensus is required only among the representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciative Inquiry Based Deliberation (another one needing naming)&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative process that focuses on moving forward on moving forward on things that there is agreement on that are &amp;quot;the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking or Vetoing Representation&lt;/strong&gt;— Voting systems where one or more members may have the right to block the deliberative process before a vote, or veto after a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute Super Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be larger than a simple majority based on the entire membership rather than only on those present and voting, typically 2/3rds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Majority or Qualified Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be greater than a simple majority of those present and voting, typically 2/3rds of those voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be 50% + 1 vote, based on the entire membership rather than on those present and voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be 50% + 1 vote of those present and voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules of Order or&amp;#0160;Parliamentary&amp;#0160;Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;— A deliberative process such as&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Robert&amp;#39;s Rules of Order&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;other rules&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;used by legislative bodies such as a senate or parliaments,&amp;#0160;but &amp;#0160;often used by corporations for decision making such as a board of directors meeting.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;At their heart is the rule of the majority with respect for the minority. Its object is to allow deliberation&amp;#0160;upon questions of interest to the group and to arrive at the sense or the will of the organization as a whole upon these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plurality or Relative Majority&lt;/strong&gt; — A voting system where when there are multiple options, the largest number of votes wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Fork&lt;/strong&gt; — Unique to open source communities, consensus can be reached by having the stakeholders lacking consensus to split off to form their own consensus, and since the assets are largely intellectual the can compete equally for the attention of the community and markets they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citizen Assembly (sometimes called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;sortition&#34;&gt;sortition&lt;/a&gt;, public sector representation, jury or allotment)&lt;/strong&gt; — A deliberative process where a representative random sample of eligible voters is selected to make binding decisions for the group. The voting system used may be consensus or some form of majority. Ancient Athenian democracy actually form of this of this in the Boule and Jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Authority&lt;/strong&gt; — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. How each group makes decisions is decided by that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Authority&lt;/strong&gt; — Rules for how a party is elected to represent a group, who then has authority to make decisions for that group, typically for a limited period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictatorship&lt;/strong&gt; — Executive authority exercised to ensure a monopoly of authority by its elected representative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Design Principles for Governing the Commons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-250wi&#34; style=&#34;width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Resource Sharing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In 2009, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia Page on Elinor Ostrom&#34;&gt;Elinor Ostrom&lt;/a&gt; received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her &lt;em&gt;“analysis of economic governance, especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia Page on The Commons&#34;&gt;the commons&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve seen a number of different versions of her list of the 8 principles for effectively managing against &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia Page for The Tragedy of the Commons&#34;&gt;the tragedy of the commons&lt;/a&gt;. However, I&amp;#39;ve found&amp;#0160;her original words — as well as many adaptions I&amp;#39;ve seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last weekend, at two very different events — one on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.futureofworking.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34; title=&#34;Future of Working Summit&#34;&gt;future of working&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and the other on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://crypto.sabir.cc/?page_id=237&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;future of the block chain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;(used by technologies like bitcoin) — I wanted to share these principles. However, I was unable to effectively articulate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#0160;I decided to take an afternoon to re-read the original, as well as more contemporary adaptions, to see if I could summarize this into a list of effective design principles. I also wanted to generalize them for broader use as I often apply them to everything from how to manage an online community to how a business should function with competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up with 10 principles, each beginning with a verb-oriented commandment, followed by the design principle itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINE BOUNDARIES:&lt;/strong&gt; There are clearly defined boundaries around the common resources of a system from the larger environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINE LEGITIMATE USERS:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a clearly defined community of legitimate users of those resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADAPT LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Rules for use of resources are adapted to local needs and conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DECIDE INCLUSIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; Those using resources are included in decision making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONITOR EFFECTIVELY:&lt;/strong&gt; There exists effective monitoring of the system by accountable monitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE KNOWLEDGE:&lt;/strong&gt; All parties share knowledge of local conditions of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLD ACCOUNTABLE:&lt;/strong&gt; Have graduated sanctions for those who violate community rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OFFER MEDIATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer cheap and easy access to confict resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOVERN LOCALLY:&lt;/strong&gt; Community self-determination is recognized by higher-level authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T EXTERNALIZE COSTS:&lt;/strong&gt; Resource systems embedded in other resource systems are organized in and accountable to multiple layers of nested communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I welcome your thoughts on ways to improve on this summarized list. In particular, in #10 I&amp;#39;d like to find a better way to express its complexity (the original is even more obtuse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;I love it Chris.  Our conversation this morning was about playing the role of the &#34;translator.&#34;  You work fast.
Quick notes:
#7 has a typo (sanction).
Could number 10 be rephrased as Internalize Externalities? (that may be even more abstract)
And at what level is ten really about feedback loops&gt; -- particularly since resources actual &#34;cost&#34; can be hard to even estimate, particularly when those resources are the result of thousands of years of natural processes (ex: oil, or fertile soil).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Christopher, let me suggest the following revisions to items 3, 5, and 10, based on:
Cox, M., G. Arnold, and S. Villamayor Tomás. 2010. A review of design principles for community-based natural resource management. Ecology and Society 15(4): 38. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol15/iss4/art38/
3.  ESTABLISH LOCALLY　APPROPRIATE RULES　FOR　USING AND MAINTAINING RESOURCES: Rules for use and maintenance of resources are adapted to local needs and conditions, and provide benefits to users that are correlated to their level of inputs.
5.  EFFECTIVELY MONITOR RESOURCES AND USERS: There exists effective monitoring of the system by monitors who are accountable to the users.
10. TIE-IN TO RELATED SYSTEMS: The resource system is appropriately connected to parent/fraternal/subordinate resource groups and to governmental systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;u-comment h-cite&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p-content p-name&#34;&gt;Excellent version. I think a critical adaptation is the active voice, as you&#39;ve done in the bold verbs.
#10 expresses a dynamic relationship with #9, yes? Thus, &#34;govern locally&#34; (or &#34;organize locally&#34;) is in relation to &#34;don&#39;t externalize costs.&#34; That is, within holarchies or (spatially, temporally, institutionally) nested set of commons or jurisdictions, both other levels and other holarchies are recognized and respected. Perhaps the positive flip on &#34;don&#39;t externalize costs&#34; would be &#34;seek to externalize benefits&#34;? In other words, seek to transmit one&#39;s learnings from such local organization up the holarchy and across to other holarchies. Like Ostrom did, and one seeks to do, by developing design principles!
&lt;/p&gt;
