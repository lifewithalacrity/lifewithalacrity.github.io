<p><em>[This is the second of a series of articles on <a href=systems_for_col.html>collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href=http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline>Shannon Appelcline</a>. It will be <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml>jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml>Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at <a href=http://www.skotos.net/>Skotos</a>.]</em></p>

<p>In our previous article we talked about the many systems available for <a href=systems_for_col.html>collective choice</a>. There are <a href=systems_for_col.html#selection_systems>selection systems</a>, which are primarily centered on voting and deliberation, <a href=systems_for_col.html#opinion_systems>opinion systems</a>, which represent how voting could occur, and finally <a href=systems_for_col.html#comparison_systems>comparison systems</a>, which rank or rate different people or things in a simple, comparative manner.</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/stars_1.gif alt=Stars_1 height=128 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Stars_1></a>One purpose of our previous article was to create a dictionary of terms for talking about these related, but clearly different, systems. Another was to start offering analyses of these systems, many of which had not been well studied before their introduction onto the Internet. </p>

<p>However at best our previous article provided an overview of what should be further investigated in each system. This article provides more in-depth coverage of one of the systems we previously outlined: <a href=systems_for_col.html#rating_systems>rating systems</a>.</p>

<p>As we wrote in our previous article, in comparison rating systems <em>"the value of individual items (most frequently goods) rise or fall based upon the largely subjective judgment of individual users."</em> Ratings systems should be clearly differentiated from the closely related <a href=systems_for_col.html#ranking_systems>ranking systems</a>. Ratings systems have a more subjective component, while ranking systems are largely objective. Amazon, Netflix, BoardGameGeek, and even the Stock Market were offered up as examples of ratings systems. Another example of a comparison rating system, and one of the earliest that appeared on the modern Internet, is eBay. The techniques they use are now beginning to show their age.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>eBay: A Failed Rating Experiment</h3>

<p><img alt=Ebaysales border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebaysales.jpg style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" title=Ebaysales>Most rating systems center around rating content, often user-contributed content, and they frequently help apply community values and acclaim to that content. However, the idea of ratings can go far beyond that narrow niche (though that will doubtless be its greatest use as the Internet continues to expand). Early Internet site, <a href=http://www.ebay.com>eBay</a>, was one of the first to widely use user-submitted ratings, and it used them for a different manner: to determine the good traders on their auction site.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as one of the first in this field, eBay made many mistakes which now leave their ratings system only slightly helpful. However, its failures can also provide us with insights in creating new rating systems on the Internet.</p>

<p>eBay allows you to leave positive, negative, or (more recently) neutral feedback for each transaction you conduct in their society. These are aggregated into two numbers. "Feedback Score" is calculated as unique positive feedback received minus unique negative feedback received, and results in a whole number like "32" or "10,302". "Positive Feedback" is calculated as positive feedback received divided by all feedback received, and results in a percentage like "100%" or "99.8%".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for reasons discussed below, almost all feedback is positive, and thus the Feedback Score acts almost entirely as a track record of how many trades someone has made. The Feedback Score could be largely replaced by that single number. You can look at a score of "27", and say, "That's an amateur trader, or someone just getting started", at a score of "3", and say, "That person may or may not know what they're doing", at a score of "10,302", and say, "That person has done a lot of trades." But you still don't know how good the trader is.</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg><img src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg alt=Ebayprofile style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" class=image-full border=0 title=Ebayprofile></a>Theoretically, the Positive Feedback percentage should give a more meaningful number, but people so infrequently give bad ratings that, even when they do appear, they look like noise. Does a percentage of "99.8%" on a user with a score of "1,762" mean that the seller has a genuine problem or not? Do those 3 unhappy customers really represent another 30 who were unwilling to actually click the negative feedback? And, did those people have slightly bad experience or really bad experiences? It's pretty hard to say.</p>

<p>Overall, eBay has a few major problems with their rating system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's <strong>non-granular</strong>, with only two options (positive/negative), or more recently three (positive/negative/neutral).</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>non-distinct</strong>, with no useful guidelines on what behaviors should result in each rating.</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>non-statistical</strong>, and thus ends up showing only a gross number of sales, not a real subjective measure.</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>bilateral</strong>, with buyers and sellers rating each other simultaneously, and thus people are afraid to give bad ratings lest they get them in return.</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>meaningless</strong>, because there are no good tools to control who bids on an auction based on Feedback numbers. (Technically it may be legitimate to ban low feedback bidders from an auction, then cancel their bids if they enter the auction, but this is neither obvious, automatic, nor simple.)
</ul>

<p>We're going to address each of these issues in turn, to offer insight into creating new comparison rating systems. The first three topics--granularity, distinction, and a statistical basis--are the most important elements of a good comparison rating system. Bilateral &amp; meaningfulness issues will only be relevant on certain sites.</p>

<p>(As a final caveat: in some ways eBay falls closer in ultimate result to a <em>reputation system</em>, a topic which we'll be covering more in a few articles down the road, but its lessons learned are still entirely accurate for rating systems of all sorts.)</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Granular Ratings</h3>

<p><img alt=Smiley border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/smiley.png style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" title=Smiley>
In general, <em>people want to be nice</em>. There are exceptions to that rule, perhaps even great numbers of them, but the average, well-adjusted person would prefer to make other people happy, not sad.</p>

<p>This has a notable effect on any comparison rating system, because it means that people are less likely to use the bottom half of any rating scale. If you did a statistical run on eBay, you'd certainly find that more than 99 out of every 100 ratings are positive. This is largely influenced by concerns of bilateral revenge, as discussed below, and the fact that eBay suggests other means of dispute resolution when you try and leave negative feedback. However, <a href=http://www.rpg.net>RPGnet</a>, a roleplaying site which reviews games, comics, books, movies, and more shows a similar trend despite the lack of bilaterality.</p>

<p>RPGnet uses two 5-points scales for reviews, resulting in a total rating of 2-10. Of all the ratings at RPGnet, 6,983 reviews have a total that's above average, a total rating of 6 or more, and 795 have a total that's below average, a total rating of 5 or less. Perhaps there are more people who sit down to write a review because they really like a game than those who do so because they really hated it, but the result of ~90% of reviews being above average is still stunning.</p>

<p>The following table shows all the ratings for each of the two categories that RPGnet uses, "Style" and "Substance":</p>
<p><a href=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9971.phtml><img alt=Rpgnetsettlersreview border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/rpgnetsettlersreview.png style="margin: 0px 0px 15px 5px; float: right;" title=Rpgnetsettlersreview></a>

</table>

<p>This evidence confirms what we'd already suspected. Only 10% of raters use the bottom two ratings in a 5-point scale, and only 2% use the bottom rating. The median of the 5-point scale is actually the fourth point, with a neat bell curve arranged around it.</p>

<p>Because users are innately unwilling to give bad ratings, as evidenced here, useful comparison ratings truly come about only through fractional differences between good ratings. In this case, the difference between "3", "4", and "5" is meaningful, and becomes more meaningful as more ratings are entered. Eventually you can look at a ranked list of ratings and see that "4.2" is a good rating while "3.5" is not.</p>

<p>In order to do this, however, you need enough levels of good ratings to be able to distinguish between them. eBay, only offering one positive rating, does not provide enough differentiation. RPGnet, with its three positive ratings, might. However, sites that offer a 10-point scale are the ones that really seem to be able to produce meaningful statistics. On those sites we can expect that 90% of users will choose between six different numbers, from "5" to "10", and as the number of ratings builds up, this will produce enough differentiation to be meaningful. If you have already adopted a 5-point scale, consider allowing users to select the half-points, giving users a greater ability to differentiate their ratings.<br> </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Distinct Ratings</h3>

<p>No two users are ever going to rate the same; different rating numbers will mean different things to each person. This can introduce minor discrepencies into ratings, if a single individual rates particularly low or high. However, because most ratings are eventually used for comparisons, if that low- or high-rater rates many different things, the ratings equalize. "Item A" is rated low by this person, but so is "Item B", and so they end up in the correct positions <em>in relation to each other</em>.</p>

<p>A bigger problem occurs when an individual is inconsistent in his ratings over time. If an individual rates everything low for a while, then rates everything high, then he has a greater chance of biasing the overall rating pool. Worse, his individual ratings aren't meaningful, because you can't look at two items, see that one is a "6" and another is an "8", and truly believe that he likes the "8" a fair amount more than the "6". This reduces the usability of an individual recommendation system or a friends system where one user might look at what other users thought about products, because their unaggregated numbers are not accurate.</p>

<p>You thus want to help individuals to stay consistent, and the best way to do that is to make the criteria for your ratings distinct. <a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com>BoardGameGeek</a>, a board game web site that supports a 10-point rating system for games, does a good job of offering distinction in its ratings. </p>

<blockquote><p><a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13><img alt=Settlers_rating_1 border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/settlers_rating_1.png style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title=Settlers_rating_1></a>

</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>10</strong> - Outstanding. Always want to play and expect this will never change.</li>
<li><strong>9 </strong>- Excellent game. Always want to play it.</li>
<li><strong>8 </strong>- Very good game. I like to play. Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game.</li>
<li><strong>7 </strong>- Good game, usually willing to play.</li>
<li><strong>6 </strong>- Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood.</li>
<li><strong>5 </strong>- Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it.</li>
<li><strong>4 </strong>- Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion.</li>
<li><strong>3 </strong>- Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad.</li>
<li><strong>2 </strong>- Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again.</li>
<li><strong>1 -</strong> Defies description of a game. You won't catch me dead playing this. Clearly broken.</ul></blockquote>

<p>If you offer a distinct rating listing like this, some users will still come up with their own rating ideas, but if they do, they're more likely to remember what each number means to them. For everyone else, a very clear, s rating system is the most likely to produce meaningful and consistent results. As long as users aren't puzzled by the distinction, they'll be consistent in picking the same numbers for the same rating every time.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Statistical Ratings</h3>

<p>The last big topic that you have to think about in creating most comparison rating systems is whether they're statistically sound. </p>

<p>The best way to make your ratings statistically sound is with volume. If you can manage thousands or tens of thousands of ratings for each item, any anomolies are going to become noise. However, the fewer ratings you have, the more likely it is that your ratings are inaccurate in relationship to your database of ratings as a whole. (And thus one of the failures for eBay is that it tries to claim meaningfulness for users with very few ratings, where there's clearly no statistical basis.)</p>

<p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes><img alt=Bayes border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/bayes.jpeg style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title=Bayes></a>
Ideally what you want to do is give items with fewer ratings among your collection less weight, and those with more ratings higher weight. One simple way to do this is to apply a <em>bayesian average</em>. Variants of this are used by the aforementioned BoardGameGeek and by <a href=http://www.imdb.com>IMDB</a>. RPGnet is using it for some unreleased software as well.</p>

<p>The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site, and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings. The basic formula looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><code> b(r) = [ W(a) * a + W(r) * r ] / (W(a) + W(r)]</code>

</p>

<p><code>r</code> = average rating for an item<br><code>W(r)</code> = weight of that rating, which is the number of ratings<br><code> a</code> = average rating for your collection<br> <code>W(a)</code> = weight of that average, which is an arbitrary number, but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items; 100 is used here, for a database which expects many ratings per item<br><code>b(r)</code> = new bayesian rating </blockquote>

<p>Say three "shill" users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a "10" because the producer asked them to. However, you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100, and thus 3 ratings won't move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>b(r) = [100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10] / (100 + 3)<br> b(r) = 680 / 103<br> b(r) = 6.60</code></blockquote>

<p>WowWebDesigns uses a similar model and even offers a <a href=http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/formula.php>good explanation of their methods</a> on their web site.<a href=http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/designs/id_242/ratings/><img src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wowwebdesignsrating.png alt=Wowwebdesignsrating style="margin: 5px;" class=image-full border=0 halign=middle title=Wowwebdesignsrating></a>
</p>

<p>With everything that's been described thus far, including granularity and distinction, a bayesian average (or some other similiar method) will probably be enough to give your ratings a good, sound statistical basis. However, sites with low volume of ratings may still be concerned with "shills" or "crappers" who come in to your site just to put "10"s on their favorite items on "1"s on their least favorite. RPGnet's reviews are an example of a site that could experience this issue, because only a few people are going to ever write reviews for an individual item, and this small number of reviews could compromise the nature of any comparisons generated by the ratings sytems.</p>

<p>In short summary the following additional methods may help with this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rate the Raters:</strong> Reviews are low volume, but presumably readers of those reviews are high volume, and you can take advantage of that to then have your readers rate the reviews. <a href=http://www.amazon.com>Amazon</a> and <a href=http://www.netflix.com>Netflix</a> are two examples of sites which use this method by asking "how many readers found this helpful".</li>

<li><p><strong>Altruistic Punishment:</strong> An alternative method for rating raters is to use <a href=../03/dunbar_altruist.html#altruistic_punishment>altruistic punishment</a>. Herein users can punish someone who does contribute to the community, but at a cost to themselves. So, a reader could flag a poor rating or a poor review at some minor cost to their own rating. Though this method may seems somewhat paradoxical, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory>game theory</a>  suggests that it is a generally effective technique for improving the commons.</p>

</li>

<li><p><strong>Adjust Ratings Based on Ratings:</strong> Ratings can be self-adjusted based upon the rater's own behavior. The simplest method here is to map a rater's average rating to the average rating for a site. For example, if the average rating of a site is 6.50 and a shill's average rating is 10.0, then those 10s should be treated as 6.50s. This has the possibility for some intensive calculations, however, and may lead to additional bias in your rating pool if shills figure out the methods you use to adjust ratings.
</li>

<li><p><strong>Allow Editorial Fiat:</strong> Another method is to allow editorial fiat, where editors are expected to come in and remove bad ratings (or proactively not release them). This clearly results in time issues, but they may not be major since only sites with small numbers of ratings/item will have to do this type of adjusting. Further, automated systems could flag "suspicious" rating patterns which are outside the norms for average, speed of rating, etc. (RPGnet supports editorial fiat by requiring editorial release of all reviews.)</ul>

<p>The idea of adjusting ratings based on ratings bears a bit of additional discussion because it's somewhat similar to another well-knowing rating system: slashdot. Herein you have both ratings and meta-ratings. People can rate threads and articles, then other people can agree or disagree with those ratings, which in turn makes it more or less likely that the original rater will be allowed to rate in the future (depending on if people agree or disagree with his ratings). Under a more general classification, this is probably a <em>meta-rating system based on a reputation system</em>, so it's something we'll look at further a couple of articles down the road.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Issues: Bilateralism &amp; Usefulness</h3>

<p>90% of the rating issues that sites will face are covered by the above. However eBay in particular raised two other issues -- bilateralism and usefulness -- that aren't as generally relevant but do deserve some consideration.</p>

<p><strong><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg><img src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg alt=Ebayfeedback style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" class=image-full border=0 title=Ebayfeedback></a>
Bilateralism:</strong> One of the reasons that eBay's ratings fall apart is that they're bilateral. Buyers and sellers rate each other simultaneously and thus there's the fear of revenge if you rate someone badly. It's a sufficient issue that eBay has a <a href=http://pages.ebay.com/help/feedback/questions/retaliatory-feedback.html>FAQ on the topic</a>, though they don't offer any good answers. </p>

<p>The following solution would address some issues of bilateral revenge:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Put a time limit on bilateral ratings</li>
<li><p>Release bilateral ratings simultaneously at the end of the time limit</li>
<li><p>Don't allow additional ratings after the time period</li>
</ul>

<p>This would work well on an eBay, where you're unlikely to conclude an additional deal with someone you rated badly, and thus there's no possibility ever for rating revenge. On a game site, however, where people are arbitrarily put into games with each other, and thus you could end up in a game with someone you rated poorly, there might be room for later revenge, down the road. This would have to be addressed to truly feel comfortable with bilateral ratings. </p>

<p>Additional investigation might reveal more variations of this method, or offer good answers for alternatives, like <em>anonymous ratings</em>.</p>

<p>In addition, good privacy restrictions are really needed to make bilateral ratings work, as well as Terms of Service that protect users from lawsuits for ratings. There have already been cases of physical threats based upon eBay ratings. eBay has also produced cases where people threatened slander or libel lawsuits for bad ratings, and this even further chills the possibility of true ratings appearing on the eBay server.</p>

<p><strong>Usefulness:</strong> Finally, you want to make sure your ratings are useful at your sites. Rankings are a good way to achieve this. You can see the "best games ever" ranked, or you can see the most interesting user content rise to the top of a long listing, and the least interesting sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>eBay offers a counter example of frustration with the usefulness of ratings. As already mentioned, you can theoretically ban "bad" users from bidding on your items, and then cancel bids from these users if they appear. However, there are multiple issues with this approach. First, how do you define "bad" users on eBay? Insufficient feedback? Too much negative feedback? Too high a percentage of negative feedback? Second, there is no automated method for doing this, so you must remain ever vigilant on your auctions to make sure that "bad" users aren't involved. Third, there's no way to keep a bad bidder from returning after you've cancelled his bid. Fourth, these bad bids and cancellations have the possibility of corrupting your auction, as you could lose other bidders who came in, saw the higher bid when the bad bidder was involved, then left before the bid was reduced by his removal. Finally, greed is a powerful motivator on eBay, which might lead to the retention of bad users.</p>

<p>You also need to be careful with your user interface for ratings. Here is an example of a poor UI:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Comparison ratings are going to be an increasingly important force as the Internet continues to mature. To produce meaningful comparison ratings for your site, you need to concentrate on four important factors: granularity, specifity, sound statistics, and usefulness. And, if you offer bilateral ratings, make sure you understand the subtleties of that as well.</p>

<p><em><a href=http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline>[Shannon Appelcline</a> is a friend and colleague of mine at <a href=http://www.skotos.net>Skotos</a>, an online game company. Over the last few years we've had many discussions about how decisions are made, and how our society collectively makes choices. The origin of these discussions have varied from "what makes this board game work?", to "how can we give our players more control of our online games?", to "how do we make decisions in our company?", and of course "how did we collectively make such a mess of decision making in America?". This article, and some followup articles, summarize our thoughts on these topics, and will be <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_178.phtml>jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml>Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at Skotos.]</em></p>

<p><img alt=Peoplearoundthesun border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/peoplearoundthesun.gif style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" title=Peoplearoundthesun> Collective choice systems have been around for a long time. Since at least the birth of democracy in ancient Greece people have made joint decisions about important issues, and since at least the knightly tournaments of the late Middle Age people have competed to be ranked against their peers. Today Western culture especially values diversity of input when implementing any type of choice, believing that wide input from a variety of people provides the fairest result.</p>

<p>The Internet expands this long history of collective choice. However, as we bring collective choice systems onto the Internet, quantifying and programming them, we discover the need to be more analytical and more methodical in the techniques used. Thus we're beginning to learn that we don't know nearly as much about these collective choice systems as we should. There is a need to analyze and study them further, to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to evaluate their social impact. Fortunately, the <a href=../../2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html>social software</a> and online games on the Internet provides the perfect <em>petri dish</em> for doing so.</p>

<p>Before any analysis can occur, however, there is a need for a categorization of systems and a definition of terms. That is the purpose of this article: to lay out at least some of the ways in which collective choices can be made, to organize them, to define them, and to briefly consider them. </p>

<p>Broadly, there seem to be three methods of collective choice, divided by the intended result: <em>selection</em>, <em>opinion</em>, or <em>comparison</em>.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a name=selection_systems>Selection Systems</a></h3>

<p>Selection systems allow for the purposeful choice between multiple items. There are many types of selection systems, but two in particular, <em>representative systems</em>, <em>deliberative systems</em>, and <em>consensus systems</em> are worth noting.</p>

<p><strong><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/19thamend.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=369,height=393,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/19thamend.jpg alt=19thamend height=159 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=150 title=19thamend></a> <a name=representative_systems>Representative Systems:</a></strong> In a representative system, individuals cast a ballot for someone who will represent their interests. They're by definition <em>voting systems</em> and the heart of any <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism>Republican</a> system of government. When you're voting for a president, prime minister, senator, congressman, director, or board member, that's representative voting</p>

<p>In most representative voting a winner is selected by <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality>plurality</a>, meaning the winner had more votes than any other candidate. This works well in a simple two-member election, but begins to fall apart if there are multiple candidates, because similar candidates can steal votes from each other, and thus allow a candidate with less popular ideas to be elected.</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to require a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority>majority</a> victory, meaning that one winner must have at least 50% of the votes. Some places in the United States use this system for their representative elections, holding a first election, eliminating all but the two biggest vote-getters, then holding a new election between these two.</p>

<p>Another solution is a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election>primary-based election system</a>, wherein all like-minded candidates compete against each other before participating in the real election. This requires buy-in from all like-minded candidates, however, and recent U.S. elections with third-party candidates like Ralph Nader and Ross Perot show the flaws in a voluntary primary system.</p>

<p>Many other types of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_systems>voting systems</a> are possible, most of which allow voters to select multiple candidates at the same time. These systems then eliminate the lowest ranked candidates and give their votes to others based upon those voter selections. </p>

<p><img alt=Irv border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/irv.gif style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;" title=Irv> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRV>Instant Runoff Voting</a>, or IRV, is a fairly commonly used multiple candidate system (though not necessarily the best one). It's technically a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Transferable_Vote>single transferable vote</a> preferential voting system. Wikipedia describes the process like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Each voter ranks at least one candidate in order of preference.<br> ...<br> First choices are tallied. If no candidate has the support of a majority of voters, the candidate with the least support is eliminated. A second round of counting takes place, with the votes of supporters of the eliminated candidate now counting for their second choice candidate. After a candidate is eliminated, he or she may not receive any more votes.</em></p>

<p><em>This process of counting and eliminating is repeated until one candidate has over half the votes.</em></p> </blockquote>

<p>It's simple to understand, but also flawed. That's because every voting system ultimately has <em>some</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">flaw</a> in it, as is evidenced by the fact that given the same conditions the different systems will often declare different winners. Different systems may also allow voters to "game" the system in different ways. This is often called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting>tactical voting</a> or strategic voting. Similar to analyzing various "attacks" when studying a cryptosystem, looking at which tactical voting approaches each voting system is vulnerable to helps you evaluate the voting systems.</p>

<p>For instance, one type of tactical voting that can be used against an Instant Runoff Vote is the push-over strategy, which Wikipedia describes as this:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Push-over is a type of strategic voting in which a voter ranks a perceived weak alternative higher, but not in the hopes of getting it elected. This primarily occurs in runoff voting when a voter already believes that his favored candidate will make it to the next round - the voter then ranks an unpreferred, but easily beatable, candidate higher so that his preferred candidate can win later. A United States analogy would be voters of one party crossing over to vote in the other party's primary to nominate a candidate who will be easy for their favorite to beat.</em></blockquote>

<p>For example, in an IRV election between Bush, Gore, and Nader, Democrats might rank Nader over Bush. The hope would be that this would give Nader enough votes to keep him from being eliminated, thus knocking Bush out instead in the first round. Afterward the Republican Bush votes transfer to the less progressive Gore, rather than the fringe Nader, allowing Gore to beat the "pushover" Nader when they couldn't have faced Bush in a straight-up fight.</p>

<p>There several different tactical voting "attacks" against various representative voting systems. One of the technically better multiple-candidate voting methods is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method>condorcet method</a> for voting. It's immune to most tactical voting strategies and more people would consider its result "correct", but unfortunately it is much harder on the voters, who have to rank every single candidate. Maybe if we can create a better Internet user-interface to condorcet voting we can make this more sophisticated representative voting system more broadly available.</p>

<p><strong><a name=deliberative_systems>Deliberative Systems:</a></strong> In a deliberative system, individuals directly make a decision, rather than selecting a representative to do so. Deliberative systems do <em>not</em> have to include voting, and the subcategory of <em>consensus systems</em> described below technically don't, however most modern deliberative sytems do. A deliberative system is the heart of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEMOCRACY>true democracy</a>. Traditionally it's been relatively unfeasible because voters were not expected to be educated enough to make governmental decisions and because they didn't have the time or capability to regularly decide on issues. The spread of the Internet alleviates at least the latter problem, since millions of people can now simultaneously decide on any issue if they so desire.</p>

<p>In the United States the best known deliberative system is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative>initiative</a> system found in some states, including California. It allows for issues to be put directly before the voters through the submission of sufficient signatures, and then allows the voters to pass or fail those issues, based on either <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality>plurality</a> (most votes), <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority>majority</a> (at least 50% of votes), or else <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority>super majority</a> (some percentage of votes in excess of 51%). In California, for example, 66% approval is required for new tax initiatives.</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/constitution_signing.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=540,height=350,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/constitution_signing.jpg alt=Constitution_signing height=129 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Constitution_signing></a>The United States constitution defines a large and very complex deliberative system. It creates three bodies of government to support deliberation and voting, and uses a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checks_and_Balances#Checks_and_balances>checks and balances</a> systems in order to allow different branches to have different effects upon a vote. The main voting is done by the legislature, which requires two <em>pluralities</em> from two different groups of people to pass a vote. Then the executive branch has a singular opportunity to veto legislature, which then requires a <em>super majority</em> (here, 66%) to override that veto. Once a law is established, the judicial department may by <em>plurality</em> vote to declare that legislation unconstitutional, but that may be overcome by an even greater <em>super majority</em> (typically, 66% of each legislature + 75% of the state governments) who want to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution#Provisions_for_amendment>amend the constitution</a>.  </p>

<p>The constitution also shows how deliberation can span beyond simple voting because of the fact that it includes specific rules for how to debate, when debate can be closed, etc. In today's very fractured congress, however, it's unclear if individuals ever are actually swayed by deliberations in the floor of the legislature, or if they've already decided to follow their party lines or their specific interests, long before they entered the Capitol buildings. </p>

<p>A smaller example of a true deliberative system, based on guiding discussions as much as holding votes, is found in <a href=http://www.robertsrules.org/>Robert's Rules of Order</a>, a guide for conducting meetings. These rules detail explicit methods not just for voting, but also for the deliberation and discussion surrounding the voting. Various <em>majority</em> and <em>minority</em> votes can be taken to allow for certain actions.</p>

<p>Because deciding directly upon ideas rather than just voting for representatives can have a greater effect upon a community, the deliberative systems may need to be more complex to avoid abuse, as evidenced by the complexities of the U.S. Government and Robert's Rule of Order. However, these very complexities can make these systems more prone to purposeful gaming. The benefits and deficits of more complex deliberative systems have not yet been fully studied, nor have there been as much analysis of "attacks" against them.</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/consensus_1.jpg><img src=../../images/consensus_1.jpg alt=Consensus_1 height=141 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=150 title=Consensus_1></a><a name=consensus_systems></a><strong><a name=consensus_systems>Consensus Systems:</a></strong> In consensus systems people jointly come to a consensus as a group through group interactions. This sort of decision making theoretically avoids the "tyranny of the majority" and likewise can produce more informed decision making. It's a variant of the broader <em>deliberative systems</em>, but one with more group and less individual power.</p>

<p>One example of consensual selection is cabinet government as laid out under the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system>Westminster System</a>. Wikipedia describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><em> Members of the Cabinet are collectively seen as responsible for government policy. All Cabinet decisions are made by consensus, a vote is never taken in a Cabinet meeting. All ministers, whether senior and in the Cabinet, or junior ministers, must support the policy of the government publicly regardless of any private reservations. If a minister does not agree with a decision he, or she, can resign from the government; as did several British ministers over the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. This means that in the Westminster system of government the cabinet always collectively decides all decisions and all ministers are responsible for arguing in favour of any decision made by the cabinet.</em></p> </blockquote>

<p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Quaker-based_consensus>Quaker-based consensus</a> offers a similar example. Herein a facilitator helps to identify disagreements and agreements to move a discussion forward until an end result is embraced by all individuals.</p>

<p>As a final note, it's important to differentiate consensus from coercion. The end result of unanimity isn't the sole definition of a consensus system, nor is it entirely required. What is required is a more open and thoughtful selection process.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a name=opinion_systems>Opinion Systems</a></h3>

<p><img alt=Poll border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/poll.gif style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title=Poll>Opinion systems are a clear subsidiary category to selection systems. An opinion system's main use is as a decision indicator, to show how people will decide or did decide in a representative system, a deliberative system, or both. Current opinion systems tend to be oriented toward actual votes, as opposed to more freeform selection systems (though the <em>delphic polling system</em> shows a more freeform version of the category itself). Opinion systems tend to be push-based (meaning people are asked for their opinions rather than actively offering them), but this isn't required. </p>

<p>All opinion systems tend to have the same general problem, which is figuring out how to use scientific means to determine the actual results of a decision. This means massaging respondent numbers to offset categories of people more or less likely to vote to try and generate the actual results. For example, one 1998 poll showed that 62% of Republicans were absolutely certain they were going to vote, while only 51% of Independents could say the same. This means that every Republican voter a poll contacted in that year might have been weighted about 1.2x over every Independent contacted. Of course the actual calculations are much more complex than that, since they tend to depend upon traditional voter turnout and lots of analysis, but the core idea is sound, which is that every polled individual should <u>not</u> be considered equal.</p>

<p>All opinion system results tend to be rated with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error>margins of error</a>. The margin of error is a percent spread which the poll is expected to be within, 90-99% of the time (depending on how conservative of a confidence rating is given). If a poll shows that a politician is expected to take 48% of the vote, for example, and the margin of error is 4%, that means he is expected to take 44-52% of the vote with 90-99% surety. Margins of error are typically given much greater importance in the modern media than they should, as they're calculated solely based upon the total number of respondents to a poll.</p>

<p>There are two general categories of opinion systems: <em>pre-voting (subjective) polling systems</em> and <em>post-voting (objective) polling systems</em>. A different type of opinion system, <em>delphic polling</em>, which could apply to either pre- or post-voting systems is also covered. Polling systems not directly related to selection systems are covered later, as <em>subjective rating systems</em>, since they tend to have issues very different from other polling systems, as their goal isn't to try and match the "true" number of an actual vote.</p>

<p><strong><a name=pre-voting_polling_systems>Pre-voting Polling Systems:</a></strong> These are polls made before a vote is cast. They're often called "opinion polls" and tend to be conducted via phone. They try and isolate "likely voters" and determine how they will vote. This question of voter likelihood is one of the first issues with a pre-voting system, because there's no guarantee that the polled people will actually later vote. Likewise, pre-voting systems have to accommodate "undecided voters" and the fact that no voter has ever truly made up their mind until they cast their final ballot. Unlike post-voting polling systems, pre-voting systems also have considerable more possibility for bias (which is not accounted for by margins of error), based upon how questions are asked, in what order, and with what additional text.</p>

<p><strong><img alt=Exitpoll border=0 src=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/exitpoll.png style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;" title=Exitpoll> <a name=post-voting_polling_systems>Post-voting Polling Systems:</a></strong> These are polls taken after a vote is cast. They're typically called "exit polls", as most are conducted as people are leaving a "polling" station (where they cast a vote). One would expect these to be much more reliable than pre-voting polls, but as the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities#Exit_polls>2004 U.S. Presidential Election</a> showed, exit polls can be wildly inaccurate.</p>

<p>One of the problems with post-voting polling systems, shared with pre-voting systems, is that the results must be manipulated to make sure that respondents to the poll match the percentages of those constituencies in the overall populations. For example, in the 2004 exit polls it appears that women were initially overrepresented in exit polls, and because of increased black turnout it appears that blacks were underrepresented in the exit polls. It can easily be seen how either of these misrepresentations could cause notable changes in an exit poll result.</p>

<p>When conducted &amp; matched correctly, exit polls are supposed to be <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy%2C_exit_polls#Reliability_of_Exit_Polls>quite reliable</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/delphiamphitheatre.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=458,height=317,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/delphiamphitheatre.jpg alt=Delphiamphitheatre height=138 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Delphiamphitheatre></a> <a name=delphic_polling_systems>Delphic Polling Systems:</a></strong> An interesting polling method applicable to all sorts of opinion systems is the "delphi poll". This is a specific method of polling which is <em>iterative</em> and <em>anonymous</em> and which supports <em>confidence ratings</em> and <em>feedback</em>. The general idea is that people are polled on a question using not just binary responses, but a full confidence rating (e.g., you would state that you are 60% sure that Bush would be elected, rather than stating that you think Bush would be elected). After polls are collected, the anonymous results--or at least a summary of those results--are shared with the participants, who then poll again. This iterative process continues until a consistent answer is settled upon. By incorporating feedback into the polling process there's the possibility for greatly increased reliability.</p>

<p>In some ways delphic polling systems can be seen as an analogy to <em>consensus systems</em>, since both involve more iterative processes that eventually result in a more commonly-held decision.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a name=comparison_systems>Comparison Systems</a></h3>

<p>Comparison systems allow individual items to be measured up against each other. There are three general categories: <em>comparison ranking systems</em>, which are largely objective and which typically rank people; and <em>comparison rating systems</em>, which more often mix subjective and objective opinions, and which more frequently rate things; and <em>reputation rating systems</em>, which again tend to rank people, but also have a subject and objective mix. </p>

<p><strong><a name=ranking_systems>Comparison Ranking Systems:</a></strong> In a ranking system, items in a hierarchy (most frequently people) rise or fall based upon specific, objective, and well-known rules. This is the heart of most multiplayer competitive systems.</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/chess.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=500,height=336,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/chess.jpg alt=Chess height=134 style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;" border=0 width=200 title=Chess></a> The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system>ELO System</a> is an example of a ranking system used for two-player games, and is used by the U.S. Chess Federation. Days of Wonder uses a <a href="http://www.gangoffour.com/index.php?t=content&amp;sub=ranking">multiplayer variant of the ELO system</a> for their online games. Each system builds a simple distribution of player ratings around a norm (typically 1500 points), then awards or deducts points based upon wins and losses, with the total sum of all points in the system staying constant. Players are then ranked according to their comparative scores. </p>

<p>There are flaws in ranking systems like ELO. For example, two players could collude, with one purposefully throwing games so that his opponent could increase his ranking. Alternatively if a player gets a few lucky victories against good opponents, his rating might temporarily skyrocket above its normative value. However, these tend to be well-known and well-researched problems.</p>

<p>These are numerous other ranking systems which are used for competitions, from double-elimination seeded tournaments (e.g., a tennis tournament) to ranked comparisons based upon win-loss ratios (e.g., baseball standings). Objective rankings are also (less commonly) used to rank items, such as a ranking of cars based upon safety ratings.</p>

<p><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/usmc_enlisted_rank_structure.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=476,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/usmc_enlisted_rank_structure.jpg alt=Usmc_enlisted_rank_structure height=148 style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Usmc_enlisted_rank_structure></a></p>

<p>Most ranking systems create a hierarchy of positive rankings (e.g., "best chess players ever"). However, a hierarchy of negative rankings may also most be used, most commonly based on a negative criteria (e.g., "biggest Player Killers (PKers)"). In addition, either direction of ranking can use threshold systems to mark positive or negative rankings that meet a certain criteria. A positive threshold might be a "Grand Master" ranking threshold for anyone with a Chess rating of 2700, while a negative threshold might be a "Player Killer" ranking threshold, for with sufficient "accidental" PKs.</p>

<p>Ranking systems are somewhat removed from the other collective choice systems listed here, since there's isn't a collaborative decision, only a collective result. However their problems &amp; results remain closely related to the more collective rating and reputation systems, hence their inclusion. </p>

<p><strong><a href=http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../images/stars_1.gif alt=Stars_1 height=128 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border=0 width=200 title=Stars_1></a> <a name=rating_systems>Rating Systems:</a></strong> In a rating system, the value of individual items (most frequently goods) rise or fall based upon the largely subjective judgment of individual users.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.amazon.com>Amazon</a> and <a href=http://www.netflix.com>Netflix</a> are two examples of stores which provide subjective rating systems. Individual users rate items from 1 to 5 stars, then an average user rating is calculated. <a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com>BoardGameGeek</a> offers a slightly different example because it not only lets users rate individual items, but also ranks items against each other based upon those ratings.</p>

<p>Flaws in these systems are similar to those in ranking systems: low numbers of ratings producing bad rankings, and individual users purposefully biasing ratings. Some mathematical methods may be used to smooth out these issues, among them <em>bayesian averages</em>, which give ratings weight based upon total number of ratings for an item.</p>

<p>The Stock Market offers an example of a different sort of rating system, because there's theoretically some objective basis to it. In a perfect Stock Market system, stock prices are based upon a solid cost analysis, such as a multiplier on yearly revenues or profits. However, as the Internet bubble of the late 1990s conclusively showed, there's also a high irrational component to stock purchases: thus subjective and objective views are combined in the rating (cost) of a stock.</p>

<p><strong><a name=reputation_systems>Reputation Systems:</a></strong> Finally, reputation systems are very similar to ranking systems: items in a hierarchy (most frequently people) rise or fall based upon specific and well-known rules. However, unlike true ranking systems, reputation systems instead base their rules for rise and fall upon other user feedback. </p>

<p>The goal of a reputation system is ultimately to create a trust metric that often allows different users access to different powers. We'll be covering reputation systems a bit more thoroughly in a couple of weeks. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are a variety of ways to measure the collective choices of a large group of people. We've outline nine here: representative, deliberative, and consensus selection systems; ranking, rating, and reputation comparison systems; and three varieties of opinion systems. When developing social software it is important to understand the difference between these broad categories of systems and to use lessons already learned from the appropriate category in your own social software designs.</p>
