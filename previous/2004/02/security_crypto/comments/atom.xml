&lt;p&gt;The RSA expo floor really makes me feel sad nowadays.  It has really driven home the lesson that security is not, as I once believed, a tool that naturally lends itself to increasing freedom.  Instead, like all tools, it cuts either way depending on the hand that guides it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain hopeful that capability access control will be deployed and will enable, in Mark Miller&amp;#39;s phrase, &amp;quot;cooperation without vulnerability&amp;quot;.  The concept of mutually untrusting code (operating on behalf of mutually untrusting people) cooperating in a single address space is a paradigm that the MUD culture has been practicing for at least a decade and that the Java culture is likely to discover in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing importance of virtualization, Trusted/Treacherous Computing, and the like also lead us closer to this paradigm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/security_crypto.html">&lt;p&gt;Just thought I would comment that  in building actuarial tables, insurance companies have a relatively small set of policy-holder behaviors and traits. Auto insurance underwriters look at  age, vehicle model and model year, zip code, driving history, and maybe a few more traits. How do you even start to build a table for the computer industry? You&amp;#39;re running Windows? Fine, double your premiums. You&amp;#39;re running Windows 95? Great, double them again. You haven&amp;#39;t updated your router firmware in three months? Well... what does that do the measure of risk? Anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always really liked the idea of IT insurance as a way to drive effective, practical security protections, but  I think we&amp;#39;re light-years away from collecting enough information to build a reliable actuarial table.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
