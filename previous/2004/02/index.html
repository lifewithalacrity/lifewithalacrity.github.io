                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>As I head out next week to the <a href=http://2004.rsaconference.com/>RSA Conference</a> I realized that it has been 13 years since I attended the first one. I remember fondly the potential and power of cryptography technology in 1991 -- public keys, digital certificates, new possibilities for privacy, digital cash, etc.</p>

<p>After 8 more years I left the compujter security industry on March 15, 1999. The computer security industry also seemed to be filled with as much potential as it did back in 1991. Amazon, EBay, and other Internet notables were still riding high, and driving before them the need for secure Internet transactions. The government's attempt to cripple the industry through their Clipper chip initiative was all but dead, and we were slowly winning the rights to export our technologies without severe and unnecessary government restrictions. We were beginning to truly see how Certificate Authorities worked in practical usage, and were coming up with plans for smaller, more efficient certs, to help bring security to wireless devices and set-top boxes.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that I left the industry at such a height, but I'd accomplished my own personal goals. I helped midwife the startup of <a href=http://www.verisign.com>VeriSign</a>, and digital certificates were now broadly available for both servers and clients. I'd helped fight Clipper, and freed RSAREF so that it could be used by Open Source software before the expiration of the patent. I'd grown Consensus Development, a company I founded almost a decade before, from a small engineering house into the premiere SSL developer. I'd lead the team that developed the SSL Reference version for Netscape, and had completed the IETF's <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt>RFC 2246</a> that described the future of SSL called TLS.</p>

<p>Thus I found myself at the heart of a burgeoning Internet commerce industry. When <a href=http://www.certicom.com>Certicom</a>, a leading cryptography company, had expressed a desire to purchase my company, I considered the returns for my investors, the value to my employees -- I was pleased with the results, and agreed. So I made an exit from the security industry, and as part of my agreement with Certicom I signed a non-compete which gave them a few years' head start before I dipped my foot back into the security industry. </p>

<p>Now, five years more have gone by. My non-compete with Certicom has expired and for over a year I have slowly been easing my way back into the world of security and cryptography. I must admit, I was a bit uncertain at first. Five years ago I had seen the industry perched on the edge of the next big change. It had been prepared to secure the hundreds of new applications that were proliferating on the net; to broadly adopt TLS, the newest version of SSL; to really look at the practical applications of certificate authorities and recreate the entire concept as a second generation of ideas. I wondered how far behind I would be, if I'd recognize the industry at all. Internet time had still been moving fast back in 1999 and I wasn't sure how many generations had gone by in the security industry. One, two, more?</p>

<p>So last year I started attending security related conferences again, such as <a href=http://www.ietf.org/meetings/meetings.html>IETF Meetings</a>, the <a href=http://2004.rsaconference.com/>RSA Conference</a>, and others. I was ready to come as a student, to soak up the new knowledge imparted in the talks and tutorials, to glory in the changes that the last five years had brought. Instead I discovered, almost nothing had changed. If anything, the industry had been moving backward, just a tiny bit. </p>

<p>What had happened to an industry that just five years ago had been rapidly pushing forward the frontiers of technology? </p>

<p>And, more important, how could it move forward? </p>

<h4>The State of the Industry: Living off of Fear</h4>

<p>Overall, I find the state of the security industry to be a bit sobering for its lack of momentum in recent years. This slowdown can be seen nowhere as easily as upon the exhibit floor of RSA Conference, the premiere conference for this industry, which I attended last year and will attend again next week.</p>

<p>Walking the floors of RSA last year, in the immense exhibit hall at the San Jose Convention Center, I did feel a sense of energy. The floor was still packed, and the carefully cut kiosks and the garish banners bespoke the millions put into the show by the exhibitors. The constant chatter was a deafening white noise, and whenever I veered too near a booth, there was a salesman very eager to tell me about his company's latest and greatest. </p>

<p>But, to a certain extent, that energy felt to me like a facade. There was nothing new; instead all the exhibitors were showing off the same technology that they were displaying five years ago. There was a bit of glitz and some extra chrome, perhaps a carefully redesigned product name, but beyond that there was a weird feeling of deja vu. </p>

<p>There were the same old tools that we've been using to deter hackers since the advent of the Morris Worm way back in 1989: products to detect intruders and safeguard your machines against them; firewalls; and VPNs. Maybe we've gotten a little better at figuring out expert rules, maybe we've improved our user interfaces, but these are slow, gradual upgrades, not quantum leaps.</p>

<p>Email still seems to be the newest battlefield upon which security wars are being fought, and you could find any number of new anti-spam tools at RSA. The Bayesian filters are a new and interesting way to statistically classify spam, but at the core level they're a dynamic outgrowth of keyboard filters that have been around for as long as we've been fighting unsolicited commercial email. RSA's big release of the year, Nightingale, was simply another way to protect sensitive online information, a competitor to Microsoft's Wallet technology. We had the ubiquitous hardware tokens too, and discussion of the recently approved AES encryption standard, but nothing dramatically new and exciting. </p>

<p>I suppose I shouldn't have been too surprised, based on my experiences at IETF a month before. Most of the Security Area working groups were still working on the same problems that they'd been discussing five years before. S/MIME is pushing forward on yet another draft of a standard that has never been broadly deployed. IPSEC is similarly continuing to work on the same problems, now years old. TLS was widely implemented and specified, but not widely adopted -- the world still uses SSL 3.0.</p>

<p>In the last year since those two conferences I had lunch with various professional colleagues that I had lost track of, continued to watch as a bystander the leading edge of security and cryptography.</p>

<p>As I overview the industry I have begun to feel that we'd largely abandoned the most interesting and innovative security techniques that were being discussed just five years ago. What happened to alternative public key infrastructures? What happened to attribute or role certificates? What happened to "authorization" being the next step after "authentication", or separating "security" from "privacy"?</p>

<p>Remarkably, if any of these topics are being considered, they seem to be moving outside of the traditional security industry. Such is the case with <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security">SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language</a>, a branch of XML which seems to be doing some of the only work on attribute certificates.</p>

<p>With so many technologies abandoned utterly, or else given up to another computer fields, we must ask: why are we stagnating, moving backward rather than forward? </p>

<h4>Fear: Outlining the Problem</h4>

<p>I thought, could it be the result of the dot-bomb and subsequent recession? Perhaps that is part of it, but we are in denial unless we face the deeper cause. If we go on as we are the security industry will not recover with the next boom.</p>

<p>The decline of the security industry is based upon a basic disconnect between the business world and the security world. </p>

<p>Within the security industry we base our models of trust upon mathematics. We strive to continually push the envelope by codifying security and improving it. On the other hand the business industry bases its models of trust upon risk. It balances the risk of a bad outcome, the cost of that bad outcome, and the cost of reducing that risk. Even if a system is technically insecure, the business world will accept it if the risk of a security breach is low, the cost of a security breach is low, or the cost of closing that breach is high. </p>

<p>Where our model is mathematics, theirs is economics. These two models worked well in tandem for quite a few years; the need for a security industry was initially obvious because of the totally undefined risks and the potentially high costs that were out there, waiting to be taken advantage of.</p>

<p>But now, years later, we've done our job too well. We've taken all those undefined risks and codified them -- made them real and quantifiable. We've offered real demonstrations of online security through years of ecommerce, and in doing so we've proven lower rates of credit card fraud, and almost total proof from high-cost offline problems like extortion and bad reputation. We've helped fill out business' risk models and so shown when we were necessary and when weren't. </p>

<p>In short, we have dug ourselves into a hole. Thus it shouldn't be surprising that the newer security technologies are stagnating ... because we've carefully, cleverly, and constantly diminished our revenues by staying with a business model in which 'good enough' security will become ever cheaper. We've turned our security business into a cheaper alternative to insurance, where business only pay for security if their insurance premiums would otherwise be too high. As the bulk of the risk is now handled by old, cheap technology, what remains for new sales is not enough to keep us truly innovating.</p>

<p>Recent statistics underline the decreasing value of innovative, new security to businesses. According to the <a href="http://www.gocsi.com/press/20030528.jhtml?_requestid=105732">CSI/FBI 2003 Computer Crime and Security Survey</a>, the annual cost of computer crime has decreased in almost every category. From 2001 to 2003, the cost for theft of proprietary information is down from $151.2M to $70.2M. System penetration by outsiders is down from $19.1M to $2.8M. Insider abuse of network access is down from $35.0M to $11.8M. The only computer crime up in dollar damage inflicted is denial-of-service attacks, a very small part of the security pie. </p>

<p>With costs due to computer crime plunging year after year, clearly companies are not incentivized to put money in new prevention technologies.</p>

<p>To simplify, as long as the risks were unknown, we were in a business feeding off of 'fear' and our security industry 'pie' was growing. But as we and our customers both understand the risks better, and as we get better at mitigating those risks cheaply, this "fear" shrinks and thus the entire 'pie' of the security industry becomes smaller. Yes, new 'threats' keep on coming: denial-of-service, worms, spam, etc., but businesses understanding of past risks make them believe that these new risks can be solved and commodified in the same way.</p>

<p>As the philosophy and culture of the business world is hundreds of years old, going back to at least the Italian merchants of the Renaissance, business isn't going to change its model of how business works. Thus, it is up to us to rework the basic beliefs and understanding of our security industry.</p>

<p>In order to get out of this hole we need to dramatically rethink how we approach, develop, and market security services. To do this requires us to reconsider our own security models, based upon a better understanding of core business models. Some possibilities: </p>

<ol><li><a href=#insurance>Enter the Insurance Business</a></li>
<li><a href=#reliabiliy>Move into Reliability Improvement</a></li>
<li><a href=#enabling>Move into Enabling Technologies</a></ol>

<h4><a name=insurance>Solution #1: Entering the Insurance Business</a></h4>

<p>Entering the insurance business is an old idea. It was once an important part of <a href=http://www.verisign.com>Verisign's</a> business plan, and no doubt of others as well.</p>

<p>At its simplest level, we can enter the insurance business by offering a guarantee against damages with a product. The main benefit of this approach is that it lets us approach security in a more rational and realistic fashion. No longer do we have to engage in an endless quest for improved security, no matter how small the risk. Instead we can assess our risks and prepare ourselves to accept manageable losses. </p>

<p>There are risks implicit in this solution as well. For the most part, those of us in the security industry are unfamiliar with the insurance business model, and thus we're entering particularly uncharted waters. In addition, we need to understand that some losses will be huge and unavoidable, such as was the case with the Code Red worm. We thus need to create business models that are acceptable to our customers, but which do not leave us entirely liable for the next utterly unforeseen worm which gets set loose on the Internet. </p>

<p>There may also be some limitations with this particular model, if the valuations of security companies are too low to insure the losses of a large corporation, such as a GM. </p>

<p>Finally, we need to ask ourselves the question: "What value does insured security provide over simple insurance?" I suspect there are some real values to customers in saved productivity and time, but further market research would be required to truly assess this. </p>

<p>A security company could offset most of these risks by a partnership with an insurance company or another business within the insurance industry. We would need deep reserves and to work together with imaginative actuaries. Together we could offer insurance against the damages of security breaches. We would be the guardians against break-ins and the fixers if they did occur. The insurance company would help estimate risks, collect premiums and pay. </p>

<p>If we chose to go it alone, we could offer risk mitigation services to insurance companies. We would guard and provide disaster mitigation services for a monthly premium. For example, when offering an anti-breakin security system, we could offer a guarantee to rebuild all certified systems if an intrusion does occur. This way we would take some, but not all, of the risks. Perhaps our presence would reduce insurance premiums enough to pay for our fees. </p>

<p>Overall, despite potential risks, I believe that using an insurance model is a strong possibility for the security industry. </p>

<h4><a name=reliability>Solution #2: Improving Reliability</a></h4> 

<p>Some of us in the security business may feel like we are already providing reliability, because many of our products prevent catastrophic risks due to break-in, theft, and other malevolent acts. However, what we generally tend to offer is data security, not data reliability. Perhaps paradoxically, at the more personal, day-to-day level, the security industry has actually reduced data reliability in the name of improved data security. </p>

<p>I can personally testify to this fact because I have, recently, lost data due to security. I encrypted a directory in Windows XP, then was later forced to rebuild my system. Apparently some of the required info to decrypt the directory was stored in some unrecoverable registry entry, because I can no longer access it. The data is totally secure, but also unavailable. </p>

<p>This anecdote isn't unusual for the security industry. Forgotten keys can often cause cryptographic-related data loss. Likewise, VPNs and firewalls introduce single points of failure into networks. </p>

<p>RSA's Nightingale technology of last year is a fairly standard security-based technology. It uses "secret-splitting" technology to divide sensitive data among two different locations, thus removing what RSA calls "a single point of compromise"; you can't get access to the data unless you compromise two machines. Clearly, there is improved data security. However it raises the same old problem of data reliability, because now data can be lost if either of two servers is lost. </p>

<p>Improving reliability of extant security protocols is a good move forward in this expansion of the industry. For example in a classic cryptography situation we might unlock data with multiple secrets, but only require a set number of those secrets to unlock the data, not all of them.</p>

<p>Consider a company who is encrypting some of their most sensitive sales and marketing data. Ten company officers might each possess a secret which together can be used to decrypt all the data. However, this introduces a clear reliability problem, as the departure of any officer could leave all sales and marketing data unreadable. (Likewise, just restricting this data access to one specific secret, such as that of the VP of Sales, introduces this single-point-of-failure condition.) Instead we could offer a high reliability, but secure situation where any five (of ten) secrets together could decrypt the data. Therefore, if an individual officer disappears, leaves for a rival company, or otherwise makes his secret unavailable, not only can he himself not access the data alone, but even if he leaves with the secret the remainder of the company's access is unaffected. And, if a company didn't think that "5 of 10" executive was the right number, they could instead only require "3 of 10" to decrypt the data ... or "7" or "9".</p>

<p>By thinking in this new methodology, by measuring security against reliability, we can offer our customers real choices and let them each choose the level of security that works best for them. </p>

<p>However, the underlying bases of cryptography let us go a step further than this. Even without considering security implications, we can make use of our existing cryptographic algorithms in order to allow for more reliable access to and retrieval of all sorts of data. In other words, we can offer protection against not just hackers, but also backup errors, system crashes, and other catastrophic failures that are actually much more likely to affect the average user than an Internet security breach is. </p>

<p><a href=http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ips-charter.html>iSCSI</a>, a remote SCSI protocol, offers very good potential for interaction with cryptography. A redundancy caching technique, somewhat like RAID 5, could be integrated with a secret share system where, e.g., the data could be read as long as 80% of the remote drives (and thus their keys) could be accessed; this allows for a very high reliability storage system because individual storage drives could be distantly located, and at the same time uses cryptographic techniques to offset reliability problems that could potentially be caused by the uncertain and fluid nature of Internet connectivity. </p>

<p>Even issues like load balancing and methods to deal with machine down-time might all be improved by some of our cryptographic techniques.</p>

<h4><a name=enabling>Solution #3: Leaving Behind Fear</a></h4>

<p>In talking about insurance and reliability I feel like I'm largely expanding upon a fairly well-known and conservative way of using cryptography. These are good first steps for companies that wish to move forward in a cryptography market that is shrinking due to our own success, but they're not necessarily enough for a major breakout into revenue sources that will make this once again an exciting industry from a business point of view.</p>

<p>What is required, I believe, is a major paradigm shift. We need to leave the whole business of fear behind and instead embrace a new model: using cryptography to enable business rather than to prevent harm. We need to add value by making it possible to do profitable business in ways that are impossible today. There are, fortunately, many cryptographic opportunities, if we only consider them. </p>

<p>Cryptography can be used to make business processes faster and more efficient. With tools derived from cryptography, executives can delegate more efficiently and introduce better checks and balances. They can implement improved decision systems. Entrepreneurs can create improved auction systems. Nick Szabo is one of the few developers who has really investigated this area, through his work on <a href=http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_9/szabo/>Smart Contracts</a>. He has suggested ways to create digital bearer certificates, and has contemplated some interesting secure auctioning techniques and even digital liens. Expanding upon his possibilities we can view the ultimate Smart Contract as a sort of Smart Property. Why not form a corporation on the fly with digital stock certificates, allow it to engage in its creative work, then pay out its investors and workers and dissolve? With new security paradigms, this is all possible. </p>

<p>Federated identity is another area for potential expansion. Secure, federated identities could offer many benefits for consumers. Imagine being able to visit a third-party seller on the Internet, automatically charge a sale to your Amazon account, then automatically ship it to your standard address, all through a single secured identity token. Federated network identity also has real applicability in the business world, as is shown by the work being done by <a href=http://www.projectliberty.org/>Liberty Alliance</a>. Through a business system like this, an auto parts manufacturer could offer his products to General Motors as part of a larger bid, all without having to specifically arrange identity with GM itself. </p>

<p>However, there are notable challenges in the area of federated identity -- challenges which a new-paradigm security industry could lead the way in solving. Distinctions must be made regarding various levels of identity security, so that, e.g., your VPN couldn't be accessed if someone gained access to your Amazon password. In addition there are real concerns from users about controlling their user information, due to worries over spam and privacy; some users, for examples, might not want information about their politics, sexuality, or interests federated with information about their family or job. For instance do we really want our information on <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> to be used by <a href=http://www.google.com>Google</a>?. These challenges demonstrate why federated identity is still a leading edge possibility for the security industry.</p>

<p>Beyond business processes and federated identity there are many other areas that the security industry should be considering, as it moves beyond the business of fear. The whole idea of Public Key Infrastructures should perhaps be rethought, and maybe we should resuscitate lost technologies such as Attribute Certificates, and some of the ideas such as local name spaces as in described Rivest's <a href=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/sdsi.html>SDSI</a>. There are also some interesting possibilities for trusted peer-to-peer environments that can be dynamically expanded on the fly. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination, if we can just think beyond current possibilities.</p>

<p>We have already seen the first wave of security technology; now we need to initiate a second, for I believe with the next wave the best is yet to come.

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>While at <a href=http://etech.weblogsinc.com/>eTech</a>, I attended a number of "social software" sessions. One thing I heard was a persistent call from folk like <a href=http://blogs.it/0100198/>Marc Canter</a> for all the vendors to support something called <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a>. FOAF is a standard for "Friend of a Friend" files, and is an attempt to make <em>machine readable</em> information about people, groups, companies, and other online resources. In particular, it is focused on representing the information that you might typically put on your personal home page in a form such that meta-data tools can interpret it.</p>

<p>If you are using the blog service <a href=http://www.typepad.com>TypePad</a> or the social networking service <a href=http://www.ecademy.com>Ecademy</a> you may already have a FOAF file without knowing it, and <a href=http://www.tribe.net>Tribe.Net</a> announced at eTech that they were promising to support it as well for their social networking service.</p>

<p>FOAF as a standard is still in a fairly primitive state -- to me it feels like HTML did during the days of the early Mosaic browser, when every good web page had to be hand-crafted in a text editor and uploaded to a server. However, like HTML, it may have great promise.</p>

<p>The first thing that FOAF may offer us is a way to exchange information between various social networking services. For instance, I just exported all my <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> friends into my own FOAF file by hand, but there are those who are working on tools to do this automatically, and once Tribe offers FOAF, services like Orkut may be forced to do the same.</p>

<p>Probably more important in the long run is that FOAF may decentralize the data that you make public about yourself -- to put the data under your own control. Owned by you rather then owned by the services you use. For instance, many people have <a href=http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/35375.html>complained about Orkut's ownership of information</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with FOAF right now is that it doesn't support very much "progressive disclosure" or privacy. Progressive disclosure is how people typically handle private information -- they disclose information about themselves a bit at a time, and as trust builds, offer more. The only small measure of privacy that FOAF has is that it has a way to obscure email addresses so that they can't easily be harvested by spammers. But all your other information is totally public. Theoretically you can <a href=http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles>encrypt your FOAF</a> file, but this method requires external PGP-based encrypted files. There is also the possibility of <a href=http://www.w3.org/Signature/>XML-DSIG</a>, however, I find this standard to also be extremely cumbersome right now. <a href=http://www.plaxo.com>Plaxo</a> is a major social networking service that has some excellent <a href=http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/000007.html>comments on FOAF privacy</a> and other issues.</p>

<p>What I want is something that allows people to make 'local' assertions about themselves and their friends, and be able to have those friends be able to 'discover' more information by using those assertions. Ron Rivest came out with an interesting method for this in an old project called <a href=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sdsi10.html>SDSI - A Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure</a> that I hope will inspire a few FOAF architects someday. To adopt his method for FOAF requires everyone to have a FOAF service script somewhere and not just a data file. But we've seen broad adoption of personal RSS and Trackback services, so I don't think this is a huge obstacle to overcome.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to play around with FOAF take over control of your own public data, I've included detailed information on how to get started in hand-crafting your own FOAF file.</p>

<h4>Hand-Crafting your own FOAF</h4>

<p>First, start with <a href=http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html>FOAF-a-Matic</a>. This is a web form page that will create a very simple starting FOAF file for you. Don't put any information in it that you don't want to be public, and skip the section on "people you know". When it asks for your email address, make sure to enter it in all lower-case. When completed, it will look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
  xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"&gt;
  &lt;foaf:Person&gt;
    &lt;foaf:name&gt;Christopher Allen&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
    &lt;foaf:title&gt;Mr&lt;/foaf:title&gt;
    &lt;foaf:firstName&gt;Christopher&lt;/foaf:firstName&gt;
    &lt;foaf:surname&gt;Allen&lt;/foaf:surname&gt;
    &lt;foaf:nick&gt;Chris&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
    &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;9ee1c03552f22e89592ce583be0ab8db0c4f2c59&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
    &lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:depiction
      rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/images/ChristopherAllen(100x100).gif"/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com"/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:workInfoHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/&gt;
  &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>The next thing is to add pointers to any other FOAF files that you might have on other services, for instance, I have a profile on Marc Canter's <a href=http://peopleaggregator.com/>People Aggregator</a> service. You should also list the place where you plan on making your FOAF file available -- you might think that this is a circular reference, but it is OK. My convention is to put the most "authoritative" FOAF file last, so that if there is a conflict the last one might override earlier ones. However, in practice I've not found that any FOAF tool I've used supports this convention. Put these right above the closing <code>&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;<code> tag.</code></code></p><code><code>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=102" /&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=network&amp;amp;op=foafrdf&amp;amp;uid=42230" /&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf" /&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now upload your file to your own web site, and then run your FOAF file through two different validators, the first being the <a href=http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/>W3C RDF Validation Service</a>. It will tell you if you've made any mistakes with the RDF aspect of the file. Then use <a href=http://sw1.ilrt.org/discovery/2003/08/validation/>Rosco</a> which will also look at your schema and make recommendations as to missing items. Unfortunately, neither validator is very good at telling you what the problem is if it finds one -- again, it is like the old hand-coding HTML days when you are debugging your web pages.</p>

<p>Once you've got your basic FOAF file working, now to enter your friends. First, add to your <code>foaf:Person</code> the following:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:knows rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This is a pointer that says "look in this document for a person with the <code>rdf:nodeID</code> of MarcCanter". You can invent any value you want for this ID, mcanter, mark, canter, etc., however, it must be a unique ID on this page.</p>

<p>Then fill out the following template for each person, putting below your own <code>foaf:Person</code> but above the closing <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=""&gt;
  &lt;foaf:name&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:firstname&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:surname&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:nick&gt;&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="" /&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>So for instance with Marc Canter:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"&gt;
  &lt;foaf:name&gt;Marc Canter&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;41e872618d70ba18a7af715083f522afe7fc3238&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=4" /&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now <code>foaf:firstname</code>, <code>foaf:surname</code>, and <code>foaf:nick</code> are not absolutely essential -- you can remove them if they are not needed. I tend to only use them when there might be some confusion, for instance, for "Arthur De Boies" has "De Boise" is a surname, and "Lori Ann Miller" has "Lori Ann" as a firstname. <code>foaf:nick</code> is useful in situatations where there is a dimunitive involved, for instance "Christopher Allen" has "Chris" as a nick, and <code>foaf:nick</code> is also used by some programs online personas or for IRC chat, such as "ChristopherA".</p>

<p>Now where did the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> come from? The purpose of this number is to obscure the email address so that it can't be harvested by spammers, yet is unique enough that it can FOAF-based applications can find people. To convert an email address to a <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> you can use <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/>sha1ify</a>. Just enter the email address that you want converted in all lower case, and copy the string it generates to the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can search and see if any existing FOAF profiles exist for your friend at <a href=http://eikeon.com/foaf/>FOAF: Web View</a>, using their email address. If the friend does have a FOAF file, add it to <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> tag.</p>

<p>When you are done, test your FOAF file with the two validators, and if it works. One common problem that the validators will fail to give you a good error message about is if any of the URLs you use contain any improper characters like &amp; - in particular, Ecademy's FOAF files use this character. Just substitute &amp;amp; for every occurrence of &amp; and it should work fine. Another problem is if any of your friends have international characters in their names, for instance "Sébastien". To avoid this problem, put the following at the top of your FOAF file above your <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag.</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once everything is working you can submit it to services like <a href=http://eikeon.com/foaf/>FOAF: Web View</a>. You can also browse your FOAF file directly by using <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/>FOAF Explorer</a>, or import it into services like <a href=http://peopleaggregator.com>People Aggregator</a>.</p>

<p>Once your FOAF file is working and submitted, you'll want to add an "auto-discovery" meta-tag to your blog or home page. This is placed in the <code>head</code> portion of your HTML code:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml"
  title="FOAF" href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf"/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you are using TypePad, it forces you to use their FOAF file for you unless you used an Advanced Template. With an Advanced Template you can remove the following tags and replace it with the above:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;MTUserIfShow field="foaf"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="&lt;$MTUserSiteURL$&gt;foaf.rdf" /&gt;
  &lt;/MTUserIfShow&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>From this point on it is just a matter of looking at other people's FOAF files and seeing if you want to add any of the other profile properties that they use. I'm trying to keep a well documented foaf at <a href=http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf>http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf</a>, and I also recommend looking at Morten Frederiksen's FOAF at <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf>http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf</a> which supports far more profile information then my FOAF does.</p>

<p>Also useful is the IRC chat channel at irc.freenode.net #foaf -- I got a lot of useful tips and advice there.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>A fascinating series of blog entries shows the promise and peril of social software and Blogs as a medium in a male-dominated technocracy:</p>

<p>In <a href=http://www.misbehaving.net/2004/02/sexist_jokes_an.html>misbehaving.net: "sexist jokes and Orkut invites"</a>, Dana Boyd writes:<blockquote>When i received this note, i simultaneously recognized the intended joke and felt the shudder of being so blatantly seen as an object.</blockquote>At <a href=http://radiofreeblogistan.com/2004/02/04/this_social_software_stuff_is_tricky.html>Radio Free Blogistan: "This social software stuff is tricky"</a> Christian Crumlish apologizes:<blockquote>In my mind, I was cracking on the phenomenon of me being linked to so many other men. I wasn't sure if this had something to do with the population of Orkut or with my own subnetwork there.<p></p>

<p>However, by using language that divided up men and women in terms of visual appeal or attractiveness, I totally slipped over the line. What might be taken as irreverant and ironic by my "real" friends, who are probably somewhat likely to give me the benefit of the doubt and have other inputs to use in order to judge my character or values, in this context managed to hurt danah's feelings: the last thing I would have wanted to do.</p>

<p>What I crossed over into was that "unwelcome gaze" issue, not unlike in one of danah's earliest posts to misbehaving in which she wrote about being invited to a coed hot-tub party by a professional colleague and finding that uncomfortable as well.</blockquote><br>
In <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/05/publicly_processing_hurt.html>Apophenia "Publically Processing Hurt</a>, Dana responds:<blockquote>Don't get me wrong: i'm not screamingly upset. Frankly, i was far more nervous and concerned about posting the damn thing than going through the situation. But i wanted to lay out the experience, the emotions for others to read and understand. Not because i had worried myself sick or magnified the situation out of proportion. It was a situation, it would pass, but maybe some good would come out of posting it for others to see. It is the raw emotions, the logic in our heads that bring us to a situation. We rarely make this visible. For those who don't understand, the goal isn't to give you fodder to attack. Instead, try understanding what life from my perspective might look like. <p></p>

<p>And then the unexpected happened. Bless his heart, the owner of said comment made a public apology. He didn't need to own up to that statement, but he did. And he went on to offer his emotional reaction to my tinge of hurt. And he continued on to defend both me, my post and my sense of humor (ah, yes, public support is the quickest way to make me respect someone). So, i'm floored. And surprised. And terribly appreciative.</blockquote>I have some understanding of Christian -- I consider myself a conscious feminist, but sometimes our male world-view sets us up for a clash. I could easily see myself in his situation, realizing that there are so few women among my connections, trying to fix that, and then falling flat on my face.<p></p>

<p>I've run into this type of thing before at <a href=http://www.skotos.net/>Skotos</a> -- one of our games <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/>Castle Marrach</a> is notable as a commercial game that has probably more women involved in it then men. This was a deliberate part of the game design, but when I talk about how and why we designed it that way it is easy for me to come across as sexist.</p>

<p>Also, the context is important. If this 'joke' had been spoken and in a semi-private medium where everyone knows and trusts each other, it would have come across very differently. Instead, it was sent to a circle of friends where everyone knew Christian, but not everyone knew each other. This is more proof that even 'friends of friends' can be a pretty distant connection. If the joke had been told at <a href=http://www.livejournal.com>Live Journal</a>, which is also dominated by women (64%), it also would have come across differently.</p>

<p>I'm even uncomfortable writing this blog entry, because no matter what I do, there is no way I can precisely understand what it is like to be in Dana's place, or any women's place for that matter. All I can do is empathize with Dana discomfort and try to not make such mistakes myself.<br>

					<h3 class=entry-header><a href=my_advice_to_so.html>My Advice to Social Networking Services</a></h3>
		



		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I have now had CEOs of three different social networks send me emails asking me to compare Orkut to their service. I've not had a chance to dig deeply into good answers for each specific one, but I did have some general advice that I wanted to offer given my <a href=../01/insecurity_at_o.html>recent experiences with Orkut.com</a>, and my <a href=../../2003/12/evaluating_soci.html>evaluation</a> and <a href=../../2003/12/followup_to_eva.html>followup</a> on various social networking services in December.</p>

<h4>Privacy</h4>
First, be extremely careful about privacy issues. For some of you outside the US, you may not know about what has been going on in the area of identity theft, but it has become a significant problem. I am not a privacy fanatic, but I am concerned that social networking services encourage people to reveal too much information too broadly, and that this will be someday be taken advantage of by identity thieves. For instance, many services ask for birthday and reveal it to everyone. You can ask for the birthday, but don't display it -- give the person's age, or birth month, but don't give the full info. I personally am particularly wary of billing address, billing zip code, birthday, and potential common security questions like name of pet, mother's maiden name, etc. These are in addition to the obvious targets of identity theft like SSN, full name, and account numbers.

<p>Orkut's interface for selectively allowing some fields to be visible "only to myself", "to friends", or to "friends of friends" is nice, but I wish it was for all fields. I also think every field by default should be set to "only to myself". In fact, all security parameters should default to reveal the least information, and have the tightest limits -- allow the user to open selectively.</p>

<p>If you are going to support all different kinds of social networks (dating, friendships, activities, business) consider finding ways to make sure that those people who are not using the service for dating are not asked for that info, and don't see it for others who are dating. People who are only using it for dating shouldn't see business info. If someone is using a service for all types of relationships, allow people to selectively set what they reveal to each group, say two columns of "only to connections who are dating" or "only to business connections".</p>

<p>Never reveal someone's email address or other critical information without them knowing about it. In particular there are issues with emails sent among members. The only safe way is to do redirection through your site (although that will cost you bandwidth.) But if you can't do that, then just tell people "your email will be revealed if you do this" -- that is enough.</p>

<p>Work hard on your TOS and Privacy terms. Don't let your lawyers rule you here too much -- find some way to get your principles out there and still cover yourself against problems. Make all the personal information that people give you be their information -- they are only leasing it to you temporarily.</p>

<p>Make it easy for someone to quit the system. Maybe offer to them to export their information in case they want to rejoin later, and give them an opportunity to send a last message to any connections they may have. Be friendly at all times, and as the market shakes out they may come back.</p>

<h4>Connections &amp; Invites</h4>
If possible, find some other way to call the connections between people "friends" -- maybe even use a unique trademarkable term. There is some power in the emotions behind the word friends that helps with the virus-like nature of social networking software, but I think in the long term it is a bad idea. LinkedIn and Spoke use the word connections which sounds too mechanical, but I think it is better then "friends".

<p>Don't encourage the "how many friends do my friends have" game. It sets up bad behaviors, and as you grow you don't want to have barriers of entry to new people who feel that they can't compete in that game. This means don't sort friends or groups etc. by the number of friends they have by default -- it can be an option, but just not be default.</p>

<p>Don't encourage people to by default upload their address book. Have that feature be off of some optional utility page. Have the default option for it to just scan for people that are already members of your system and to forget the rest -- that is effectively what I do with systems that ask for address book information, and they make it hard for me to do so. Don't store people's address information for them unless you can sync them with people's personal contact books -- save that for version 2.0, not 1.0 beta.</p>

<p>Don't focus on people contacting new people that are not already their connections. It is not the number of connections, but the quality. Instead, focus on helping people with their weak connections. It is 'reconnection' that is the most powerful feature of these social network services, not new connections. You can also help with "triage" -- how do I maximize the value of my existing weak connections with the least effort?</p>

<p>Allow people to opt-out with a custom message. What this means is that if someone sends an email to someone who has opted out, they will get something like. "Thanks for inviting me to Orkut -- I've decided for now not to join, but you can find me on Tribe." However, keep a list of people who have tried to connect to that opted-out user, and if that user does change their mind later, it will make it easier for them to have an initial list of friends that may already be on the service. Yes, I know that this risks sending people to other services, but there are so many now that you can get good buzz by doing the right thing, and recovering those people later when they have confidence in you.</p>

<p>You need to have better methods of handling invites from unknowns without saying no. For instance "I'm not sure I know you, have I forgotten?"</p>

<p>Related, don't fill out default text for invitations and other request forms -- force people to put something personal into the request, don't allow it to be blank. Never do what Orkut does and not give the opportunity to offer text when you invite someone who is already on the system.</p>

<p>Avoid anything beyond friends of friends as a primary part of your service. It bugs me that I see by default 3 degrees away in many services -- 2 degrees should be max by default, as that is the level that real referral can work. 3 degrees is too far for users to trust (though it can be optional for some purposes, or useful internally.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=6080f857- 4784-4679-8e41-c6881ed933ce">Friendship Circle</a> may also be a good idea, though perhaps how you classify people should be private. You may mark someone as being "family" "intimate" or "acquaintance" or "business", or whatever, however, no one else should see that; they should just see "connection" unless they have named you, and you in turn should not say that.</p>

<h4>Profiles</h4>
Find some better way then simple lists to do profiles. Someone's profile needs to express the richness of who they are -- it also needs to change and grow and flow over time, so make it easy for people to annotate and grow over time. Consider asking for only a few things at first, not make the process of filling out the profile feel daunting, then after each login prompt them to add one small thing that is useful based on how they used the service recently. For instance "You have joined the AnyoneButBush2004 group -- do you want to enter information to share with others about your political interests?".

<p>Right now lots of people are experimenting on their blog sidebars how best to profile themselves -- learn from them. Look at hundreds of examples, look for patterns beyond the obvious.</p>

<p>Allow people to have multiple affiliations, whether they be work or play. I'm a bad edge case personally, with too many hats to name, but almost everyone I know has at least two professional hats "Sysadmin by day, Writer by night", "Laywer on weekdays, Carpenter on weekends" , as well as several affiliation hats "Bay Area Costumer Guild president, member of League of Women Voters", etc.</p>

<p>Right now LinkedIn has the best looking professional profile, but it is still hard for some people to use. I like LinkedIn's use of multiple professional affiliations, however, I wish I could mark some as major or minor; for instance, there is a big difference between being an Advisor to MG Taylor and being CEO of Consensus. It also doesn't handle professional associations and lesser affiliations, much less non-professional affiliations and interests. Also, being able to arbitrarily order them would be nice, LinkedIn does it by date which can make for some confusing emphasis.</p>

<h4>Reputation &amp; Endorsements</h4>
Be very careful of the design of rating systems and reputation systems. They are extremely difficult to design well, as they too often can be gamed, or fall into reciprocity such that they are meaningless. My personal advice is just don't do it at first -- save it for a 2.0 version of the product, not 1.0 beta. If you are going to do it now, really study it -- there is a lot of good academic research on issues of reputation. It can be hard to slog through but it is worth it. Offer a grant to Danah's school for them to do research for you on the topic.

<p>Endorsements are a best way of doing reputation for now. They is also is imperfect and vulnerable to reciprocity games, however, as least you can see if two people are playing that game just by looking at the endorser and endorsee. If you find too much reciprocity you can basically ignore both players.</p>

<p>Allow endorsements at a more granular level. For instance, if you are offering dating and professional information, segregate the endorsements. Even more ideally, do like LinkedIn and allow endorsements of relatively small things in a profile, for instance "I really enjoy Chris' blog" against the blog profile item, and "I like what Chris says about the environment" against my affiliation with a group. Consider allowing endorsements of groups: "Of the three groups here on Wiki, I find this one fits me the best".</p>

<p>If you can afford it, consider hiring a game designer from the online game industry who understands behavior incentives in online games. If you can't, study it. Part of the reason why EverQuest is the largest MMPORG is because it incentivizes certain kinds of social behaviors. In fact, it could be considered to be a type of social network service.</p>

<h4>Launch &amp; Support</h4>
Be careful with your beta launch -- a culture for a community forms in the first few weeks, and our experience from online games is that the nature of this culture can make or break a project. Find ways to encourage the kinds of behaviors you want, and discourage those that you don't.

<p>Be very careful of labeling people who are gaming your product in ways you don't like. Being in Orkut's 'jail' is almost becoming a badge of honor. There is no reason why people who invite too many friends to join, submit too many posts to forums, or sends too many messages to friends of friends, should be put under the same label as those people who put child pornography up on your system and thus you've banned them. Instead, slow down the overly active people, just say in advance "If you invite this number of people, you may not invite more people for 24 hours, do you want to continue?", or "If you invite this person, you must wait an hour before inviting another.", etc. Also, if you do lock people out of a feature, don't lock them out of all features, just the one that they are over-using. If someone gets locked out of lots of features at the same time, then they should be looked at for possibly banning, but not if they are doing just one thing -- you want to encourage their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Make sure you give feedback to anyone that tries to be helpful, for instance in reporting a bug. Ideally public reports should be encouraged public (as this encourages other people to be helpful) but even private reports should be encouraged, and as promptly as possible including "Thanks for taking time to write up this, we are logged this problem and hope to get to it as soon as we can given limited resources." Find other ways to give feedback, such as a weekly report, or a group developers blog.</p>

<p>Create multiple stages for your beta, for instance "profile features beta", "group features beta", "scaling beta", "load beta", etc. Tell people in your beta what you want to hear about and not hear at each stage. As each stage ends, find some way to publically thank those who made the biggest difference.</p>

<p>Set up a bug tracking system like TypePad has (like Bugzilla but hugely simpler to use). From help menu at the top you can click to post a new report, see all open reports, or see all closed reports. Every help page can have at the bottom to open a report on that topic. If anything goes wrong there (404, various system error messages, etc) you should give you an opportunity to open a report. </p>

<h4>Features</h4>
Figure out how to use RSS everywhere for input and output -- if Orkut or Tribe's group features supported RSS feeds, they could be very powerful competition to the hugely funded Friendster. Figure out how to use trackbacks with your system, and make them simpler for users. Make group bookmarks and other lists available as OPML. I'm not a huge fan of FOAF yet, but figure out how to use it anyhow (and maybe vCards) until something better comes along, if nothing else but allow someone to import it and export it.

<p>My personal take is that if you can combine a substantial number of these <br>
features, you could have a great product that gives the others a run for the <br>
money:<br>
<ul><li>Offering intentional groups (like Tribe and Orkut) is essential. It is Friendster's and LinkedIn's weakest link.</li><br>
<li>eVite/Meetup style invitations for both private functions (come to my birthday party), friend functions (anyone near 00301 want to have lunch Thursday?) and groups (Let's all meet for dinner next week to discuss this).</li><br>
<li>Ability to import via RSS the recent items from my blog to my profile page</li><br>
<li>Optional blogging-style home pages (FunChain &amp; Live Journal) for those who don't already have blogs</li><br>
<li>Extended family support as an explicit type of group, grandmother, mother, child in college<br>
<li>Couples can be a form of a group also</li><br>
<li>Better ways to organize groups of groups</li><br>
<li>Better support for user-optional presence "There are members of this group who are reading it right now who have said that they are available online to members to this group, 3 via Skype, 12 via AIM"</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=94333937-ecd8-4d08-994d-7f4c96c523dd">Permachat</a> at a group level is an interesting idea. I hate that I can't see chat text before the point I logged in</li><br>
<li>Lots of group management support, for instance:<br>
<ul><li>ability to have multiple admins (eGroups, Live Journal)</li><br>
<li>Group moderation (Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Advogato, etc.)</li><br>
<li>Optional group shared links (eGroups)</li><br>
<li>Optional group shared calendar (eGroups)</li><br>
<li>Polling inside groups (no one that I know of)</li><br>
<li>Invitation or approval of entry by different methods, such as by vote, by 1 reference from existing member, etc. (none that I know of)</li><br>
<li>Ability to merge groups (none that I know of) </ul><li>Wiki-style areas available for groups (no one that I know of)</li><br>
<li>Combine all the above with good innovative RSS and optionally Atom (FunChain, SocialText)</li><br>
<li>Supports the various blog submission APIs for blogs, wiki, and groups (none that I know of)<br>
<li>Do a great job for those who don't use RSS and those APIs to use email instead, including email submission (you can mail pages to a SocialText wiki)</li><br>
<li>Ability to be federated, i.e. I could still use my existing blog (you just mirror it), RSS aggregation, my FOAF file could be synced, you sync with my addressbook at Yahoo, etc.</li><br>
</ul><p></p>

<h4>Business Models</h4>
Business models for social networking services is going to be one of the biggest issues. Even those social networking sites with lots of money behind them are going to have difficulty because there are so many.

<p>The paid subscriber model is probably dead until some of the VC funded startups go out of business. Advertising can be a good model, but be careful not to make it obtrusive -- remember, Google has made good money with very simple ads.</p>

<p>If you don't have VC funding, find ways to co-opt partners -- build from the beginning support for Google AdSense and Adwords, Amazon APIs, etc. If you are small, consider federating with another company. Figure out what you can do to differentiate yourself from both your competitors and partners.</p>

<p>Don't be evil.</p>

<h4>Me</h4>
I am interested in getting more professionally involved with social software. I think we are still in Apple II days of social software -- we see the promise of things to come, but we are still typing in ALL CAPS. Given the overfunding in this field, my own ability to start a company as an <a href=http://www.alacrityventures.com>angel investor</a> is insufficient, so I'm looking to partner with others. I've been involved with online communities, groupware, collaboration, and security for over 20 years. If you are interested in an executive in this area, see my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">profile on LinkedIn</a>.

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I've not just been spending time looking at social networking services, I've also been digging deeper into wiki. I've still got more to go, but some of these will be of interest to you if you are considering implementing a wiki for your community, or if you are a wiki developer.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.zwiki.org>Zwiki</a> is based on Zope, and thus has a very interesting feature set. One of the more popular features is the topic mappings that it creates. When combined with the CMS features of Plone, it becomes even more interesting -- one of the best Zwiki/Plone communities to look at as an example is <a href=http://doc.hydrogenaudio.org/wikis/hydrogenaudio/FrontPage>Hurricane Audio</a>. Unfortunately Zwiki only works on the Zope web platform, which is not as popular as Apache.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.flexwiki.com>FlexWiki</a> is a very innovative wiki that is being developed by some Microsoft engineers and is ASP.NET based for Windows. I in particular like the <a href=http://flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.ExamplePropertyPage>property page features</a> which are an elegant way to handle meta-data, and also how it handles diffs.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.projectforum.com>ProjectForum</a> and <a href=http://www.courseforum.com>courseforum</a> are both fairly simple but elegant commercially supported wiki. Of particular note is that both are very easy to install, even on a Windows 2000 system or Macintosh, as well as on Linux. I was able to get a test ProjectForum up on my Windows PC in about 5 minutes, including downloading. It also has some nice "skins" available. I also like how private areas are created for each -- this is the basic difference between the two products, and a rare wiki feature.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/>WikidPad</a> is interesting because it is not a public service, but a shareware single-user "notepad" for Windows that supports wiki-style TextFormattingRules and WikiWords. If you have been using wiki a lot like I have, sometimes you catch yourself using wiki-style text everywhere, and I guess this product is for people who do that like me.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.socialtext.com>SocialText</a> is another commercially supported wiki, but is sold as a service not a product. They are very carefully added features while keeping things elegant and simple for less sophisticated business customers. They also host a number of public wikis, so if you want to see the current feature set see <a href=http://http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest>RSS-Winterfest</a> which also shows off their newest RSS support.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.seedwiki.com>SeedWiki</a> is another wiki service rather then product (sometimes called a WikiFarm), and is interesting because it doesn't use Wiki style TextFormattingRules -- instead, it has several WYSIWYG editors that allow you to directly edit the underlying HTML. This gives a huge amount of flexibility for some of the communities that use it, such as <a href="http://www.seedwiki.com/page.cfm?doc=WikiFish&amp;wikiid=1231">WikiFish</a>.</p>

<p>I also have heard good things about PHPWiki and MoinMoin, but I haven't had a chance to dig into those very much yet.</p>

<p>I personally have been using <a href=http://www.twiki.org>TWiki</a> for 4+ years at several of my businesses. Its strength is that it is oriented toward allowing private groups who can manage their own access privileges. It also has one of the most active 'plugins' developer areas with lots of ways to modify your TWiki to do different things (one of the plugins I'm investigating now is <a href="//http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/EvEm>EvEm</a>). My only complaints are that TWiki is rather hard to install, and that the default skin isn't very elegant (I recommend the <a href=">GnuSkin</a>, but read the docs very carefully as you have to chmod a module if you install it.)</p>

<p>Although it uses a fairly primitive wiki, I highly recommend the <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki>Meatball Wiki</a> site for people very interested in wikis. It is a meta-wiki discussion community. It has some great pages on the life-cycle of wikis, on various design patterns and features of wikis, and of various other consequences of the medium. If you look at <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?back=CategoryWikiEngine">CategoryWikiEngine</a> it has one of the more complete lists of Wiki engines out there.</p>

<p>I will be reporting more on various wikis and wiki technology that I discover in the upcoming weeks.</p>

					<h3 class=entry-header><a href=confirmed_email.html>Confirmed Email Privacy Hole at Orkut</a></h3>
		



		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>Another Orkut user and I have confirmed a privacy hole in Orkut whenever you send a message to someone via Orkut.</p>

<p>For instance, whenever I send a message to anyone in the system that is forwarded by email, in the message headers it will read:</p>

<blockquote><pre>From: "Christopher Allen" &lt;member@orkut.com&gt;
Reply-To: "Christopher Allen" &lt;christophera@alacritymanagement.com&gt;;</pre></blockquote>

<p>When someone reads the message in their email software, the "From:" line will be my name but the fake email of &lt;member@orkut.com&gt; -- however, when you reply to it, it will use my real email address. This appears to happen whether or not I have my privacy settings to reveal my email address. For instance, I can set it so that no one (not friends, not friends of friends, only myself) can see my email address, but the address will still be revealed when I send an email</p>

<p>I had reported what I thought was a security flaw when you emailed to "friends of friends" a couple of days ago, but I was mistaken, as I reported in my blog <a href=../01/insecurity_at_o.html>Insecurity at Orkut</a>.  However, as I didn't want risk "crying wolf" this time, so my friend and I triple checked this and have confirmed this privacy flaw.</p>

<p><s>They only way that I know of to avoid this is in your prefences to set that all of your messages should be sent to you via the web, not email.</s> [Updated: I was wrong, there is no way currently to avoid this other then not using an email address you care about.]</p>

<p>There are some that will say that this is a feature, i.e. when using email "what good is communicating with someone if there is no chance of a response" -- my answer to this is that an expectation has been set that email addresses can remain private, and if this is to be a feature, then users should be warned before sending an email "Your email address user@domain will be revealed when you send this." More ideally, like other social networking services, the "Reply-to:" should be to a special email address at Orkut that will do the lookup and forward appropriately.</p>

<p>One of the essential problems that Orkut needs to fix very soon is how to report problems like these, and if you are trying to help how to know that these problems exist. I want my criticism to be constructive, but it is very hard when you have no idea what is the best way to offer feedback. I've had many people reply to me in my blog and via email that they feel the same way.</p>

<p>For instance, right now there are 6 Orkut groups about Orkut:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=617">What Should Orkut Do?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=2026">Flaws in Orkut</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=3982">Orkut</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=1289">Orkut Design</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=781">Orkut: Tips, Feedback, ?'s</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=4556">Orkut Members</a></ul>

<p>Which groups should I post this problem to? Which will will be read by the Orkut staff?</p>

<p>As I've said in another of my blog postings <a href=followup_on_ork.html>Followup on Orkut</a>: <blockquote>Part of the problem is that even though Orkut is in beta, there is no organized feedback system. For instance they could offer a forum read by the developers, or even better a bug/issues tracking system like TypePad has, or Bugzilla.<p></p>

<p>In addition, feedback is a two-way street -- they could do a lot by offering a developers daily blog, or some type of regular announcement of what feature they wanted beta testers to test that day, or even acknowledgement "we already know that is an issue". Also, they need to show respect for good feedback publicly, as that will encourage more good feedback.</p>

<p>None of this is happening at this time, which means that people get frustrated, which also makes it easy rumors and conspiracy to spread. I want to be a constructive critic, but Orkut makes it hard for me to be so.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>For now, I recommend that these type of bug reports go into <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=6048">Orkut Beta</a>. Why not in "Flaws in Orkut" or in one of the other groups? Because I feel that focusing on 'Flaws' is too strongly negative, and none of the others quite fit. I've been a software developer -- everything is a compromise and good design is hard. By staying on the topics of current features, feature requests, bugs, suggestions, and by encouraging constructive critism and a balance of both positive and negative feedback, this group will be the best community for us to help Orkut until they offer us better alternatives.<br>

                                <p>I've read of emails, Orkut messages, and blog postings since my <a href=../01/insecurity_at_o.html>post yesterday</a>, so I thought I would share some with you.</p>

<p>There have been a number of good posts, as well as user comments at Danah Boyd's blog <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/>Apophenia</a>.</p>

<p>Danah Boyd writes <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/01/correcting_marc_canters_perception_of_my_views.html#004011>Correcting Marc Canter's Perception of My Views</a><br>
<blockquote>Marc - i don't believe that users should take these relationships more seriously; i believe that YOU should. Users will do whatever they damn well please, and i think that we should learn from them. But out of respect to the creators of these systems, many of whom are our friends, i truly believe that we should respect their goals and not engage in behavior that disrespects their intentions. Furthermore, i believe that we should never be the exceptions on any given service, the ones who push the boundaries. We are not average users. We should sit back and watch what average users do, not try to top them. By engaging in disrespectful behavior, we make it much harder for our friends and colleagues to execute their business plans as they're busy policing us.</blockquote>When I first read this, I thought of something else. When I saw Danah's "YOU", I was thinking of myself and Marc Canter as developers. I'm not currently involved in developing Social Software, but I come from the developer mind set. "WE" developers "should take these relationships more seriously". That means that although our users will game, will play, and stretch the system, we should design it as seriously as possible those who are serious, concerned, and value their relationships.  "Calling someone a friend" <b>should</b> mean something -- something important.<p></p>

<p>Danah Boyd asks in <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/31/banned_from_orkut.html>Banned from Orkut</a> <br>
<blockquote>I keep hearing about folks who have been kicked off or "jailed" from Orkut. I'd love to hear more about this. Who all is getting banned? Why? Are you given explanations? What happens when you try to fight?</blockquote><p></p>

<p>I offered in the <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/31/banned_from_orkut.html#comments>comments there</a> some of my observations on being "jailed" now there twice.</p>

<p>Danah asks <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/what_is_beta_in_the_context_of_social_software.html>What is Beta in the context of Social Software?</a>:<br>
<blockquote>What does the term 'beta' mean in social software? It's become an ongoing joke since Friendster is *still* in beta.<br>
...<br>
I find it quite disconcerting that people want to label their distributions "beta" for over a year because it hasn't been perfected, because new versions are coming out. This, to me, seems like an abuse of the term beta. New versions always come out. Is beta simply an excuse?<br>
...<br>
I am really uncomfortable with public distributions of software being labeled as beta (or alpha), particularly when the population joining it is not aware of it being truly an alpha/beta.</blockquote>I think this is important -- just saying something is 'beta' is too easy. We've have learned this in the online game industry -- how beta is managed sets the culture of your community very early on, and has a huge effect on "buzz". <a href=http://www.darkageofcamelot.com>Dark Ages of Camelot</a> Game Designer Dave Rickey wrote an excellent column on this at Skotos last month <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/engines13.phtml>Plan Your Fight</a>:<br>
<blockquote>The problems arise because of the differing agendas of the parties involved in bringing the games to and through the beta process, and their differing expectations of what they are supposed to accomplish. The fact is, our traditional Alpha/Beta division does not serve the needs of these games well. Well before the full featureset is in place, the complexity surpasses the point where internal QA processes are adequate to cope. You simply can't even make a serious attempt at full-regression organized QA; the manpower requirements are far too high.<br>
...<br>
Beyond that, there are the marketing implications. Ideally, Beta isn't about marketing, it's about making the games work. In the real world, only a fool ignores the impact of "beta buzz". Beta testers telling their friends "You've got to try this game" is the most powerful marketing force in the industry. A few thousand evangelists working their personal social networks is better than millions of dollars of paid advertising. By the same token, beta testers saying "don't bother, it sucks" can kill a game, no matter how much money is spent on marketing.</blockquote>He further recommends that beta be actually broken into more categories <b>Development Beta</b>, <b>Playtesting Beta</b>, <b>Scaling Beta</b>, and <b>Load Beta</b>. Part of the problem with Orkut is that they are lost in Scaling and Load Beta, when they need more Development and Playtesting Beta.<p></p>

<p>Another interesting blog entry found from in a comment at Danah's site, written by Jeremy Zawodny: <a href=http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001504.html>Why Google needs Orkut</a>:<br>
<blockquote>What surprises me is that nobody has looked at it the other way around: What problems might Orkut solve that Google would otherwise find significantly more challenging?<br>
...<br>
Suddenly they're able to set a *.google.com cookie that contains a bit of identifying data (such as your Orkut id) and that would greatly enhance their ability to mine useful and profitable data from the combination of your profile and daily searches.<p></p>

<p>Of course, we know that the "big three" already do this sort of thing to some degree or another. But Google's lack of intimate knowledge of their users is surely holding them back from doing some of the things they'd love to do. Many folks think it's just a matter of time before they try to get "real" users signed up.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>I personally don't think Google is institutionally really that aware of Orkut. If anything, the negativity that the beta has raised may actually be causing this skunkworks group some headaches, given that Google is trying to go public. But yes, in the long term if Orkut is successful and absorbed into Google, this information will be used this way.</p>

<p>In a <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/01/correcting_marc_canters_perception_of_my_views.html#comments>comment to Danah's blog</a>, <a href=http://www.bladam.com/>Adam Lasnik</a> writes:<br>
<blockquote>I have agreed with the majority of your complaints about orkut, danah, and indeed, have found myself also disappointed in what I feel is the lost opportunity (so far) for what Orkut (the guy) and Google (the company) could have set up from the get go. They have the means, the finances, and so on to have set up a truly sophisticated and thoughtful social network. I still optimistically think that orkut.com will amount to something impressive (useful and/or just damn fun) someday, though I wish the structure had been more sophisticated from the beginning.<p></p>

<p>With that said, I do have to agree with what I read from someone else recently (apologies -- the specific source is escaping me!) about how perhaps the ambiguity and unsophisticated structure of orkut.com is intentional... letting members shape things as they go along, almost as folks might build a sim-city from the ground up.</p>

<p>Perhaps. And perhaps not. I don't know.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll continue to use orkut.com until it's either no longer fun and useful for me, or I feel it has no hopes of BECOMING fun and useful. At that time (and probably before), I'll be airing my concerns privately to the orkut.com team and publicly on my blog... but I'll maintain my respect for Orkut, orkut.com, Google, and the service terms to which I agreed to when I signed up.</p>

<p>I wish others would do the same.</blockquote>Adam further points to his blog entry <a href=http://www.bladam.com/archives/0401302002.htm>Don't like it? Go home and don't come back</a>:  <p></p>

<blockquote>But on the whole, I think folks who are unhappy with orkut (or any other privately-owned-and-run service) have exactly two choices:
<li>stick with the service, but publicly or privately express concerns
<li>quit the service (and, yep, still publicly or privately express concerns if they wish)</blockquote>

<p>In general I agree with Adam, if you are unhappy quit.</p>

<p>However, his first choice was "publicly or privately express concerns". I've been chastised for expressing publicly concerns about Orkut. For instance I was sent this message from someone by the Orkut message system:<br>
<blockquote>You are a bit annoying, and you seem to go about making things a better in the same way a child goes about crying to his mom because he didn't get his 4th lemon pop in a row.</blockquote>Other then my first mistaken email about a possible "friends of friends" email security issue, I feel that my comments have been constructive. Yet obviously I've hit some nerves (probably a good thing for Orkut that people are feeling that passionate to be defensive about it).<p></p>

<p>Part of the problem is that even though Orkut is in beta, there is no organized feedback system. For instance they could offer a forum read by the developers, or even better a bug/issues tracking system like TypePad has, or Bugzilla.</p>

<p>In addition, feedback is a two-way street -- they could do a lot by offering a developers daily blog, or some type of regular announcement of what feature they wanted beta testers to test that day, or even acknowledgement "we already know that is an issue". Also, they need to show respect for good feedback publicly, as that will encourage more good feedback.</p>

<p>None of this is happening at this time, which means that people get frustrated, which also makes it easy rumors and conspiracy to spread. I want to be a constructive critic, but Orkut makes it hard for me to be so.</p>

<p>I've also received some interesting comments via email or Orkut messages.</p>

<p>This one about my concern about emails revealed when you send to "friends of friends":<br>
<blockquote>When you give your trust to anyone, they can choose to abuse it, just like in real life. For example, I don't know how delighted Megan is that you chose to compose your glorious-whistle-blowing-yeah-look-at-me-I-pretended-I-was-friends-with-these-people-but-I am-not-and-I-am-so-r337-in-exposing-a-"security hole"-in-this-site message, but, as always, these actions can be remedied. For example, she can choose to remove you from her friends list, just like in real life "friends" who abuse someone's trust are not their friends anymore. This way you also very efficiently negatively advertise yourself to all of her friends so that they now know to stay away from you.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>I wonder if this type of behavior will happen? So far on any of these social networking services I've never seen a message "you have been removed from X's friend list". It is possible that I have been removed by someone, but so far I have not been told. And will someone look at someone friends list and say "ah, he is no longer on there, so I will remove him". Right now, I doubt it.</p>

<p>One of my favorite messages sent to me on Orkut:<br>
<blockquote>I don't like that it's not easy to opt out. I've already had to delete a flame from my "scrapbook" and I could see how this could turn ugly quickly. Without an opt-out I don't see how I have any way of getting out of there quickly if there's a problem. Maybe what they need is a way for me to put myself in jail for a period of time.</blockquote><p></p>
