I have been receiving countless phone calls from guys asking me how much i charge. This is pathetic because i don&amp;#39;t even know any Junaid and i had never heard of this site till some guy called and told me that my cell no. was on display and so was my name under the call girl list.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Today however i got a real shock when i logged into my account at about 1:15 pm GMT. There were horrible messages sent from account to all my freinds [scribbled on their scrapbooks mostly], messages like &amp;#39;hey guys i am gay&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;you suck!&amp;#39;. my user name and password to my account are known only to me. i dont knwo how someone got access to my account and sent these messages to all my freinds and made posts in my name on the communities i am a member of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my first instinct was to remove my account altogether from orkut. but then i thought that this was precisly what the malicious act was meant to do, to intimidate me ne and annoy me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but i am seriously not sure what i should do to ensure my id is not stolen again. any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<summary>I have been playing around with Orkut a lot in the last 24 hours. One thing I don&#39;t understand about...</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with Orkut a lot in the last 24 hours. One thing I don&amp;#39;t understand about these Social Networking Platforms is why they ask for useless information and why they don&amp;#39;t ask for the interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Orkut gives me five large textareas to explain things like what I have learned from my past relationships. It lets me give Karma-Points to Phil Wolff if I think he is sexy. It lets me upload photos of my cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it does not ask me if I have ever met Phil in person. (I have.) It does not ask me for how long I have known him. It does not distuinguish between &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;acquaintance&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It asks &amp;quot;Is xxx your friend?&amp;quot; and I am supposed to give a &amp;quot;thumbs-up&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;thumbs-down&amp;quot;. (And if I say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; I cannot even add an explanation to that. I hope I haven&amp;#39;t hurt anybody.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get it. It would be so easy to gather this information and it would be so valuable. A simple &amp;quot;have met in person&amp;quot;-flag or something like &amp;quot;How often have you met X?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;never - once - several times - often - meet regularly&amp;quot; would do it and give so much more depth to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it that I am missing? Why is Orkut not gathering more data about the relationships of its members? (Like most of the information it could be optional - I bet many people would share it.) Please enlighten me.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<summary>I&#39;ve joined a few social networks, revealing things about myself that I don&#39;t mind if everyone reads. Things I don&#39;t...</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve joined a few social networks, revealing things about myself that I don&amp;#39;t mind if everyone reads.  Things I don&amp;#39;t want &amp;#39;everyone&amp;#39; to know, I don&amp;#39;t add to these networks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also choose my communities/tribes/groups knowing everyone will be able to see my interests, and have avoided joining some I considered interesting but don&amp;#39;t want linked to my profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use disposable email addresses for social groups; when weaknesses are found, I&amp;#39;m not disturbed by it.  I think others might be though, because they might reveal more about themselves that what I did.  I&amp;#39;ve changed my settings to not expose my address to everyone (I think, there&amp;#39;s a lot of places to check).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s good that weaknesses are exposed, even publicly.  Not picking on any particular network, but if a person found a weakness in it, and reported it to them, there&amp;#39;s a chance it would be missed/overlooked/ignored.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there are some that would take a reported weakness about their network very seriously, probably not as many though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by making the weaknesses public, I think it puts a fire under the developers to patch the hole.  Would Orkut&amp;#39;s hole have been patched as quickly as it was if the persons that found the hole had reported it to them instead of publicly?  Maybe, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a network does take immediate measures to patch holes as soon as they&amp;#39;re reported, I&amp;#39;d think it would be nice to give them advance notification before going public with the breach.  But I&amp;#39;m pessimistic about this, and think it probably takes threat of bad publicity to get some networks to patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up the good works; your blog is very interesting, and I&amp;#39;ve subbed your RSS in my Bloglines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Later I find out by looking at other people&amp;#39;s information that this is all completely public. It isn&amp;#39;t limited to just friends, or friends of friends, but instead is prominent. In fact, other then your name and how many &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; you have, your relationship style is the most prominent thing listed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I&amp;#39;d like to see more &amp;quot;progressive disclosure&amp;quot; where there was more granularity of what was revealed at public, friends of friends, friends, fans, fans who I&amp;#39;ve endorsed, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s quite a bit of granularity already, since launch, which you continue to ignore. Every one of your hypothetically incomfortable tidbits of information are filterable by social distance, that is, yourself, friends, friends of friends, everyone. And I can only expect that you will be able to filter by karma/fan, since that would be one of the only primary benefits to the end user of the karma system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what you mean by &amp;quot;XML hole&amp;quot;. Perhaps you meant XSS? To my knowledge, the precise reasoning for Orkut&amp;#39;s shutdown has not been revealed, but judging by what I&amp;#39;ve noticed has changed, it seems like they took it down to remove the ability of users to broadcast messages to the everyone on the site. The reply-to-all button is gone, and you can no longer send a message to a saved search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of more applicable (and offensive) words for the orkut-bashing chicken-littles than &amp;quot;unseemly&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

His assertions aside, Marc is by far not the most prolific linker, and has not been adding friends as fast as some others, who are neither in Jail nor suspended. Other, much less prolific linkers, have been suspended, all of which share the fact that their actions (the posting of children pics) violated an admittedly stupid TOS provision. At this point, it&amp;#39;s Marc&amp;#39;s assumption (&amp;quot;they don&amp;#39;t like me, because I link a lot of people&amp;quot;) against a trend in suspensions that is closely related to what images have been posted.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In fact, I later received an email from Orkut saying &amp;quot;Your account was blocked by the system automatically. The block is temporary. Your account should be fine now. I apologize for the inconvenience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;#39;t know why I was in &amp;quot;jail&amp;quot; last night, and in fact, now I&amp;#39;m in &amp;quot;jail&amp;quot; again late today, so I can only assume that it is because I sent another email to &amp;quot;friends of friends&amp;quot; as that is the only common event between last night and today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they use the &amp;quot;jail&amp;quot; for TOS as well as for slowing down people like Marc and I, then I think that is a big mistake to use the same name for both purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">&lt;p&gt;The only reason why I&amp;#39;d seen other people in jail was because they had added too many friends too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no basis in this assumption other than, maybe, a little hubris. The constant repetition of this unfounded claim speaks volumes about the research and professionalism of those perpetuating it. Marc, at least, had a question mark after that sentence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, some people have been &amp;quot;jail&amp;quot;-ed for violating the Orkut TOS, namely the posting of images of children or nude photography. One person I know of has been suspended for posting copyrighted images. Now, one may think that the limitations are overly stupid and should be changed, but as it stands a look at Marc&amp;#39;s profile shows, that he has been most likely suspended for the images of his children. I think is is safer to assume, he has been &amp;quot;jailed&amp;quot; for violating the TOS, than for having too many &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
