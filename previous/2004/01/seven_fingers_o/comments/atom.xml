			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html">&lt;p&gt;While looking for show tickets for a present I accidentally found out this troupe is actually from Montreal and doing shows home these days. Went to see the show yesterday. They&amp;#39;re indeed excellent! I think two of the original creators are no longer in the show, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of people came in late and entered together about 10min into the show through the fridge door as Patrick (the short, comic guy) was standing on top of it. Coming in on the stage is already disorienting, but seeing them being welcomed by cast members mid-act under the spotlights with everyone else sitting was delightful.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
