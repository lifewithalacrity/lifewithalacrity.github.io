                                <p>While I've been out attending the <a href=http://www.sxsw.com>SXSW Music, Movie and Interactive Conference</a> there has been a flurry of high-quality postings about Social Networking.</p>

<p>Unlike many of my fellow bloggers, I find it difficult to post meaningful blogs while I'm on the road. It has been my policy in my own blog postings to also be "high-signal, low-noise", so normally I don't just post links without solid additional commentary, however, I'm making an exception this time because of the quality and depth of these entries.</p>

<h4>How Do We Categorize Relationships</h4>

<p>Clay Shirky writes in Many to Many <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/03/16/relationship_a_vocabulary_for_describing_relationships_between_people.php>RELATIONSHIP: A vocabulary for describing relationships between people</a> which is a commentary on a new proposal for <a href=http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/>mapping relationships</a> in <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a> (see also my previous blog on <a href=../02/handcrafting_my.html>FOAF</a>):<p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Here, just in case you were wondering, is how you should be characterizing your relationships with one another:</p>

<p>friendOf, acquaintanceOf, parentOf, siblingOf, childOf, grandchildOf, spouseOf, enemyOf, antagonistOf, ambivalentOf, lostContactWith, knowsOf, wouldLikeToKnow, knowsInPassing, knowsByReputation, closeFriendOf, hasMet, worksWith, colleagueOf, collaboratesWith, employerOf, employedBy, mentorOf, apprenticeTo, livesWith, neighborOf, grandparentOf, lifePartnerOf, engagedTo, ancestorOf, descendantOf, participantIn, participant</p>

</i><p><i>Describing relationships with a controlled vocabulary can sound credible right up to the moment you see the vocabulary, but this thing is a mess.<br>
...<br>
The RELATIONSHIP list should make it obvious that explicit linguistic clarity in human relations is a pipe dream. It probably won’t though — the madness of the age is to assume that people can spell out, in explicit detail, the messiest aspects of their lives, and that they will eagerly do so, in order to provide better inputs to cool new software.
</i></blockquote>

<p>Make sure you read the comment's in Clay Shirky's blog entry -- some good discussion.</p>

<p>Ian Davis writes a response to Clay's posting in <a href=http://internetalchemy.org/2004/03/clayShirkyOnRELATIONSHIP>Clay Shirky on Relationship</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>There are a number of themes in Clay's post. The primary theme appears to be one of completeness: Clay's thesis is that the vocabulary is incomplete because it doesn't provide properties to model composite relationships: what if you are employed by a colleague you collaborate with?. Clay seems to be implying that he expects the terms to be exclusive. Of course they're not. It's perfectly meaningful to assert that Jane employedBy John and Jane collaboratesWith John. RDF supports this kind of assertion and you can also express it with the HTML method outlined in the vocabulary.<br>
...<br>
Obviously I'm pleased that Clay has taken the vocabulary seriously enough to critique in detail. Somehow the thought that everyone would ignore it caused me more concern than the fear that everyone would hate it.</p>

<p>Despite all the obvious thought Clay put into his piece, he still managed to overlook the raison d'etre for the relationship vocabulary. Indeed it's the raison d'etre for all vocabularies. Without these vocabularies, incomplete and imperfect as they are, we would be mute in the machine readable web, unable to express ourselves in any meaningful way. You only have to look at the etymology to realise that vocabularies give you a voice.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Like Clay I too am concerned with this relationship proposal, for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>First, I'm not sure that I like the "negative" relationships. There is a good argument against using negative relationships in the <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn/background#positive>XFN Background</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Negative relationship terms have been omitted from XFN by design.  The authors think that such values would not serve a positive ends and thus made the deliberate decision to leave them out. Such terms (we won't even bother naming them here) while mildly entertaining in a dark humor sort of way, only serve to propagate negativity.</p>

<p>The authors do not deny that such negative relationships exist in the real world today.  Of course they exist.  However, we see no need nor benefit to standardizing such relationships and capturing them in a form which would spread on the Web.  There is enough hatred in the world.  We should work to eliminate hatred, not to spread it.</p>

<p>And we do realize that by creating <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn>XFN</a> and the mechanisms it uses (<a href=http://gmpg.org/xmdp/>XMDP</a>), we have opened a Pandora's box, and have made it easier for those that would create and propagate negative relationships.  We can only hope that our positive creation wins out over any such negative creations.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Secondly, I am uncomfortable with both the relationships in <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a> and parallel ideas in <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn>XFN</a> because they in both proposals these are "exposed" publicly. I am comfortable with saying that I "knowOf" someone, but when forced to categorize publicly everyone even more precisely, I become uncomfortable. Am a I committing a faux-pas when I say that I am a "friendOf" someone when they think I'm a "closeFriendOf"?</p>

<p>Lastly, I'm concerned about complexity -- once you start down the slippery slope of defining relationships, things can get incredibly complex. Even if don't include concerns about ethnocentricity (as <a href=http://www.michael.bauser.name/20031225T045828Z>Michael Bauser writes</a>), there just seems to be no end in sight to how specific you might be required to be. Becoming more specific typically results in more precision, but in this case, as these are very fluid human (or even primate) definitions, wrought with emotion, may result in them being less precise. Maybe the real answer should be much simpler four: knowsOf, professionalColleagueOf, personalFriendOf, and shareFamilyWith.</p>

<h4>Are Social Networks Useful?</h4>

<p>Judith Meskill asks in <a href=http://www.meskill.net/archives/000565.html>Musings On Autonomic Social &amp; Knowledge Networks</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>If you utilize one or more of the current entrants in this swell of online SNS offerings [such as LinkedIn, Friendster, Orkut, Ryze, and/or Tribe] - what value, if any, do you derive from them? And, harkening back to the citation with which I started this post, has one [or more] of these services assisted in helping you to successfully reduce the 'traffic congestion' at the 'intersections' in your life? And, in closing, any insights, comments, or ponderings on the recent and future blurring of lines between 'wetware,' 'software,' and 'hardware' in an infinitely connected wireless world?</i></blockquote>

<p>Stuart Henshall answers in Unbound Spiral <a href=http://www.henshall.com/blog/archives/000817.html>Social Networking is Broken</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>This slightly facetious statement: "My social networks are broken... at least I think they are." reflects my conclusion that the social networks I've been playing in are for the most part associative networks. While they have a social element the socializing for the most part takes place by blogs, forums, IM / e-mail, phone and in face to face visits.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It's time to put a stop to categorizing these "things" as social networks. Call them "Associative Networking Tools" or "Structured Association Tools" or something similar. Then you can create a bucket for them. The reason there is no real business model is they are just part of / or component towards building our capabilities to enhance "presence" and connectivity.</p>

<p>What have we learned.</p>

<ul><li>We don't socialize rather only associate through the Orkuts while we socialize using messaging, telephone and face to face visits.</li>

<li>The opportunity to connecting through friends is much greater than generally understood. Some successes have been achieved. </li>

<li>Virtual connections mean managing ones connections and presence has never been more important. </li>

<li>Structured services are creating problems where there were none before. From categories to access. And designating "artificial" forced levels of buddies or friendship.</li>

<li>Fragmenting association systems does not enable better connections.</li> 

<li>Integration on to my desktop (address book / IM systems) at minimum and preferably into my cellphone is required for there are few you can synch with and while one can upload addresses you can seldom download. </li>

<li>The sites themselves are seldom responsible for the association, the connective knowledge is broader than the networking sites. eg blogs, blogrolls, online forums etc.</ul>

Denise Klarquist writes in <a href=http://weblog.cheskin.net/blog/archives/000216.html>SNAM - Too much of a good thing?</a> (via <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a394>Dinah Mehta</a>):

<blockquote><i>Each time I'm invited to join or add someone (frequently unknown to me) to my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/>Linkedin</a> network, or asked to update my contact information via <a href=http://www.plaxo.com/>Plaxo</a> (again, usually by someone I barely know) I wonder how far my online social network extends. And how useful it really is. I'm still intrigued and excited by the possibilities of online social networking. But I'm hoping to see more of the benefits before the noise dampens my enthusiasm.</i></blockquote>

<p><a href=http://www.chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/>Chris Corrigan</a> offers a similar concern in a comment in Dinah Mehta's blog <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a395>Social Networking - Too Much Noise?</a>:

<blockquote><i>
<p>"Seems to me that social networks have a hard time existing in the absence of a reason to do so. I have played around on Ryze and Orkut and to be honest they hold no glamour for me. I have a number of real life social networks from whence my business comes, and my weblog provides me with another social network from which I derive a lot of learning.</p>

<p>But I could never find a reason for the Ryze's and Orkuts of the world. And without a reason to network, networking becomes just noise.</p>

<p>One application for these types of things that I am working with a little is using social networking software to support emerging Aboriginal leaders here in British Columbia Canada who are working on interesting things in remote and far flung communities and who will really benefit from have some contact with each other. </p>

<p>But I wouldn't dream of inviting them to Ryze. Interesting, eh?"</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>Lately I've been noticing the spread of a meme regarding "Dunbar's Number" of 150 that I believe is misunderstanding of his ideas.</p>

<h3>The Science of Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Dunbar is an anthropologist at the University College of London, who wrote a paper on <a href=http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/05/65/bbs00000565-00/bbs.dunbar.html>Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans</a> where he hypothesizes:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... there is a cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships, that this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this in turn limits group size ... the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained.</em></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar supports this hypothesis through studies by a number of field anthropologists. These studies measure the group size of a variety of different primates; Dunbar then correlate those group sizes to the brain sizes of the primates to produce a mathematical formula for how the two correspond. Using his formula, which is based on 36 primates, he predicts that 147.8 is the "mean group size" for humans, which matches census data on various village and tribe sizes in many cultures. The following chart shows the distribution produced by Dunbar's analysis:</p>

<p align=center><img src=http://www.bcg.com/images/this_is_bcg/strategy_institute/brain_size_02.gif><br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Source: <a href=http://www.bcg.com/strategy_institute_gallery/gorilla3.asp>Boston Consulting Group</a></span></p>

<p>This number of 150 has become "Dunbar's Number" and has been popularized by various very popular business books such as Malcolm Gladwell's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a> (<a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0111705/categories/collaboration/2003/12/21.html#a358>summary</a>), Duncan J. Watts' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041425/ref=pd_skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age</a> (<a href=http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/reviews/Podolny/>review</a>) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691005419/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Small Worlds: The Dynamics of Networks between Order and Randomness</a> (<a href=http://www.ams.org/notices/200008/rev-chow.pdf>review</a>), and Mark Buchanan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041530/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks</a> (<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/16209;jsessionid=baadd3W3trYipI">review</a>), the ideas from which are the foundation of the various Social Network Services that I've discussed elsewhere in this blog.</p>

<h3>Revisiting Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Lately, Dunbar's number has been taken as a mean size for online networks and groups, as shown in <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/02/12.html#a284>Ross Mayfield's Weblog</a>, where he states:

<blockquote>
<table border=1><tr>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Network</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Size</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Description</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Distribution</span></strong></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Political Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~1000s</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as mass media</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Power-law (scale-free)</span></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Social Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~150</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogging Classic</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Bell-curve (random)</span></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Creative Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~12</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as dinner conversation</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Dense (equal)</span></table>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Dunbar's work itself suggests that a community size of 150 will not be a mean for a community unless it is highly incentivized to remain together. We can see hints of this in Dunbar's description of the number and what it means:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The group size predicted for modern humans by equation (1) would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.<br>
...<br>
My suggestion, then, is that language evolved as a "cheap" form of social grooming, so enabling the ancestral humans to maintain the cohesion of the unusually large groups demanded by the particular conditions they faced at the time.</em></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar's theory is that this 42% number would be true for humans if humans had not invented language, a "cheap" form of social grooming. However, it does show that for a group to sustain itself at the size of 150, significantly more effort must be spent on the core socialization which is necessary to keep the group functioning. Some organizations will have sufficient incentive to maintain this high level of required socialization. In fact the traditional villages and historical military troop sizes that Dunbar analyzed are probably the best examples of such an incentive, since they were built upon the raw need for survival. However, this is a tremendous amount of effort for a group if it's trying not just to maintain cohesion, but also to get something done.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Dunbar specifically restricts himself to physically close groups:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.</em></blockquote>

<p>My anecdotal evidence generally seems to support the idea that group sizes will usually plateau at a number lower than 150 participants. This comes from 20 years of doing facilitation both on and offline, running several software companies, and running various forums at America Online. In particular, many online communities provide good evidence for Dunbar's Number actually being an upper limit (either due to reduced efficiency or due to increased dispersion).</p>

<h3><a name=onlinecommunities>Dunbar &amp; Online Communities</a></h3>

<p><em>Ultima Online</em> provides one of the best examples of what sizes an online community will support because it's well documented and the overall game size is large enough to generate many smaller communities. If you look at <a href=http://www.legendmud.org/raph/>Raph Koster's</a> statistics for the size of groups in <em>Ultima Online</em>, you will see a definite point of diminishing returns at around 150; however, you will also see that most groups are around 60 large.</p>

<p align=center><img src=../../UOGuildHistogram.jpg alt="UO Guild Histogram"></p>

<p>Jessica Mulligan, executive producer at <a href=http://www.turbinegames.com/>Turbine Games</a>, confirmed these numbers to me:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The numbers match up with my (currently) mostly anecdotal evidence for <a href=http://ac.turbingames.com>Asheron's Call</a>.  We have allegiances in the hundreds and even thousands of members, but most of those members are inactive, non-participatory in the group on a regular basis or are mule accounts for farming XP.  It is rare to have more than 40 or so active participants in an Allegiance.</em></blockquote>

<p>I've seen similar limits myself in some of the small online games that <a href=http://www.skotos.com>Skotos</a> produces. For instance, in <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach>Castle Marrach</a>, which is a social-dominant game (i.e. like a MUSH), the game grew quickly until we reached approximately 150-200 active users. However, whenever it grew beyond that number, it always seemed that politics and dissatisfaction would bubble up such that people would drop out, leaving us back close to 150 or 160. (That we would ever exceed 150 is a bit of a surprise, but I think it's due to any number of factors, including a variable 24-hour user base, wherein on a given day we might only see a little more then half of our community members, below Dunbar's Number, and only get up to close to 200 or so over a full week.)</p>

<p>We have had some games at Skotos that do manage to overcome Dunbarrian social limits, prime among them <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/eternal-city>The Eternal City</a> which regularly exceeds the Marrach community by more then double. However, TEC is a much more achievement-oriented game, meaning that people spend much of their time interacting with the environment -- fighting monsters and training skills as it happens -- rather than directly interacting with other players all the time. Thus social limits become less important.</p>

<p>Other online communities that I've had experience with have been more traditional, and thus more closely met my expectations for Dunbar's Number acting as a limit rather than a mean. When I managed the Mac Developer's Forum community on AOL, a forum would start to break down when it reached about 80 active contributors, requiring a forum split before continued growth could occur. Wikis provide another good example; the WikiPedia, one of the largest active Wikis online, appears to have hovered at approximately 150-175 <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators>active administrators</a> for over a year, in spite of a huge growth in usage during the same period.</p>

<p>These numbers just keep coming up.</p>

<p>This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time "grooming" to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don't have <a href=http://www.doceo.co.uk/background/requisite_variety.htm>requisite variety</a>.</p>

<p>

Thus Dana Boyd gets it right when she uses the word MAXIMUM in her <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/11/my_etech_talk_revenge_of_the_user.html>eTech Talk</a>, not average or mean:

<blockquote><p><em>[Dunbar] found that the MAXIMUM number of people that a person could keep up with socially at any given time, gossip maintenance, was 150. This doesn't mean that people don't have 150 people in their social network, but that they only keep tabs on 150 people max at any given point.</em></blockquote>

<h3>Expanding Dunbar's Numbers</h3>

<p>To open up the discussion a bit, I'd also hypothesize that Dunbar's Number is just one datapoint in an overall equation describing what group sizes work and what don't. Working our way up from the smallest group sizes, I think we can find many break points, both above and below Dunbar's Number of 150.</p>

<p>In my experience the smallest viable group size seems to be somewhere in the range of 5 to 9.</p>

<p>Looking smaller, we see that a group of 2 can be tremendously creative (ask any parent), but often has insufficient resources and thus requires deep commitment by both parties. Notably, often the difficulty of a 2-person business partnership is compared to that of a marriage. A group of 3 is often unstable, with one person feeling left out, or else one person controlling the others by being the "split" vote. A group of 4 often devolves into two pairs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of "team" really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough "attention" is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Although I've been unable to find the source, I've heard of some references to a study from the 1950s that says that the optimum size for a committee is 7. Likewise, it's fairly easy for us to see and agree that a dinner party starts to break down somewhere above 7 or 8 people, as do also tabletop games of both the strategic (I prefer 5) and role-playing varieties (I prefer 7). These size limits can be overcome, but require increased amounts of "grooming". </p>

<p>The chasm that starts somewhere between 9 to 12 people can be especially daunting for a small business. As you grow past 12 or so employees, you must start specializing and having departments and direct reports; however, you are not quite large enough for this to be efficient, and thus much employee time that you put toward management tasks is wasted. Only as you approach and pass 25 people does having simple departments and managers begin to work again, as it starts to really make sense for department heads to spend significant time just communicating and coordinating (and as individual departments become large enough to once again allow for the dynamic exchange of ideas that had previously occurred in the original 5-9 member seed group).</p>

<p>I've already noted the next chasm when you go beyond 80 people, which I think is the point that Dunbar's Number actually marks for a non-survival oriented group. Even at this lower point, the noise level created by required socialization becomes an issue, and filtering becomes essential. As you approach 150 this begins to be unmanageable. Once a company grows past 200 you are really starting to need middle-management, but often you can't afford it yet. Only when you get up past that, maybe at 350-500 people, does middle-management start really working, primarily because you've once again segmented your original departments, possibly again reducing them to Dunbar-sized groups.</p>

<p>The following chart shows anecdotal satisfaction ratings for these lower group sizes:</p>

<p align=center><img src=../../GroupSatisfaction.jpg alt="Group Satisfaction"></p>

<p>Much of this is probably predicted by Dunbar's model, if you add in the non-survival and dispursed community modifiers that I discuss here. Essentially, as we increase group sizes beyond 80, to 150, 200, or even 350-500, we typically do so by breaking larger groups down into smaller ones, and continually reducing community sizes down to the point where they can be understood and managed by people -- and so efficiency reasserts itself.</p><br>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I spent most of last week at the RSA Conference in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Like last year, I found little that excited me. I overheard from a convention staffer that they had 30% more attendees, so the conference is growing again, but my week there also reinforced my opinions regarding the industry as a whole as I describe in my previous blog posting <a href=../02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a>.</p>

<p>I asked a number of random people what they thought of the conference. Some agreed with me, saying that they were troubled by the lack of innovation. Others said that they actually liked it -- it showed that the industry was being run by businessmen finally, and not by geeks. Others said that it was just the inevitable maturation of an industry. Tim Oren wrote in his blog <a href=http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2004/02/27.html#a565>Due Diligence</a>:<blockquote>Every year the show is less about cryptography per se. I'm sure this has something to do with RSA's attempts to diversify as its patents expire, but I do think it reflects the state of the field. Crypto has become a standardized component of security solutions, and the biggest perceived threats are not in the privacy area.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The hilight of the conference to me was hearing respected cryptographer Whitfield Diffie say to me that he had read my <a href=../02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a> and that he liked it. Apparently it had been sent to him by someone at Sun who had thought that it was saying many of the things that Diffie has been saying as well. Diffie said that he had some specific criticisms, so I hope that he'll comment here someday on them.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Caller-ID for Email</h4><p></p>

<p>The big announcement of the week was that Microsoft will be be releasing their own spam solution, a <a href=http://windows-help.net/cgi-bin/2004/7.08.cgi?70801>Caller ID</a> for email addresses, starting this summer in HotMail and in their mail servers. Basically the way this works is that every domain holder publishes inside their DNS records the IP addresses of any valid outbound email server. This information is stored using XML in a special signed format. After a mail is sent, the receiving system queries the DNS to confirm that the outbound server is not being spoofed.</p>

<p>This is a very similar technique to what a number of other companies are proposing, for instance AOL is backing a proposal called <a href=http://spf.pobox.com/execsumm.html>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> or sometimes "Sender Permitted From", and Yahoo is backing <a href=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1430976,00.asp>Domain Keys</a>. Unfortunately, Microsoft's Caller-ID proposal requires XML, which makes implementation much more complicated. It requires the entire email to be received by the server first, before looking up the DNS record, then validating a signature -- all of which introduces more burdens on the mail server. Lastly, this XML may exceed the 512-character limit for DNS requests, which can cause DNS servers to send via TCP rather then UDP, which may introduces even more uncertainty.</p>

<p>It is good to see that Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo are taking spam seriously, but I do worry that that the burden of supporting more then one of these standards may be significant. This could mean that only large corporations, educational institutions, and ISPs could host email, whereas small companies, third-world organizations, and individuals could not. I would prefer that one solution be broadly and easily adopted. <font color=red><s>Daniel Goldman</s></font> <font color=green>Yakov Shafranovich</font> in <a href=http://www.shaftek.org/blog/archives/000061.html>NetWizard's blog</a> is also concerned about patent claims and lack of IETF participation:<blockquote>At the same time none of these proposals have been submitted to any standards bodies such as the <a href=http://www.ietf.org>IETF</a>, and as a matter of fact <a href=https://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/asrg/current/msg09082.html>Microsoft was invited</a> to submit "Caller ID" and participate in <a href=http://www.ietf.org/ietf/04mar/marid.txt>this week's meeting at the IETF on the subject</a>, but <a href=http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg00023.html>they declined</a>. At the same time the community had jumped on Caller ID's patent license by declaring a (and <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/02/26/1448253&amp;mode=thread">a possible incompatibility with the GPL</a>). Of course it remains to be seen what exactly does Caller ID claim to patent since RMX and other prior art existed at least since 1998, and if Caller ID ever makes it to the IETF, Microsoft will have to deal with <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3669.txt>the new IPR guidelines (RFC 3669)</a> which favor non-patented technologies.</blockquote>I'm also not convinced that even if these techniques are deployed (Gartner group <a href=http://informationweek.securitypipeline.com/news/18201583>predicts</a> less then 25% will implement these in the next two years) that they will not return us to early 1990's levels of spam, only just slow down the onslaught. For instance, in a similar fashion to current WiFi war-chalking, a spammer could wait until an authenticated user logged in a mail server and hijack that connection. Unless the link is encrypted and authenticated, it is possible for a spammer to impersonate the legitimate user without anyone being the wiser. Related, these techniques do not necessarily help with the growing threat of "phishing" -- emails that lure unsuspecting users to enter credit card or bank account information into fake web sites.<p></p>

<p>I am also concerned that all of these standards require some measure of public-key infrastructure, including management of public-keys, which many security analysts believe that we are not doing a good enough job now.</p>

<p>There is some good thoughtful analysis of these three standards by Larry Seltzer of eWeek in <a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,1761,a=120536,00.asp">Who will Win the SMTP Authentication Wars</a>.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>More Security in Windows XP SP2</h4><p></p>

<p>Bill Gates also discussed new security features in the upcoming Windows XP SP2. In addition to some interesting "Active Protection Technology" to prevent overflow attacks, he discussed built-in virus protection and an improved built-in firewall that also warns of outbound connections.</p>

<p>Out in the hall I heard some people saying that announcement was a good basis for selling Symantec short, while others countered that Microsoft never gets these type of things right and there would always be business for Symantec. Companies that offer more minor features like preventing browser popups will be hurt. However, as these solutions are already free and ubiquitous, this is one of the few cases where I prefer for these to be in the default Microsoft install. However, I do worry for the smaller but more innovative security vendors like ZoneAlarm.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Sessions</h4><p></p>

<p>Over the years the sessions at RSA have become more managerial and corporate in nature, but there were a couple of good technical sessions that I attended or friends commented on.</p>

<p>I was pleased by the Cryptographer's Panel response to Bill Gates' announcements: "We have a lot of great levers in cryptography, but we're missing the OSes and platforms that can really serve our keys," said Ronald Rivest. "Bill Gates didn't talk about simplifying things, but that's the only way we are going to get security. We're not smart enough to handle the complexity of this stuff. You have to get the complexity out of there," continued Paul Kocher. Whitfield Diffie criticized security the upcoming Windows Longhorn release because "For the first time, you will have a PC that does NOT do what you tell it to." </p>

<p>The Cryptographer's Panel also spoke on the topic of electronic voting, and supported calls for paper ballots to supplement and verify votes cast with new electronic voting technology. Rivest cautioned "We know only too well the difficulties of securing complex electronic systems."</p>

<p>I also heard good things about the "Hacking VM Machines" and "Analyzing Topologies of Trust" sessions, and the closing keynote by PJ O'Rouke, but I missed them -- anyone have any notes? Where there some other good sessions I missed?</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Exhibits</h4><p></p>

<p>The exhibit floor was again a bit droll for me.  Like in previous years the floor was dominated by vendors selling rather high-end corporate systems that might have excited me more if I was in the market for one, but I was looking for less expensive systems for smaller businesses. Like last year there were lots of dedicated devices, such as firewalls, spam prevention, VPN and intrusion detection hardware, and fewer companies offering software to use with my existing hardware.</p>

<p>I did like some of the biometric hard drives, but investigating more deeply I just can't trust them yet. No one yet offers a good solution for redundant key storage yet for these, as a backup in case of a physical failure.</p>

<p>I did see one company <a href=http://www.authenex.com>Authenex</a> that was offering free USB keys that supposedly allow you to encrypt files on your system and email them to someone else with a different key -- it looks like some public key technique is being used, with the key serving as a pre-generated private key storage. More interestingly, they claim that if you register your USB key at their website, they can send you a replacement key that you can use to decrypt your old files. I'll have to do some more investigation of the technology behind this, and if they've had adequate study by cryptographers that I trust. If they have, and they start offering storage on those keys as well, they may have something useful that I'll buy.</p>

<p>RSA had an demo of it's <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/company/news/releases/pr.asp?doc_id=3376">prototype RFID blocker tag</a> that they suggest is a possible solution to some of the fears that some of us privacy advocates have been worrying about. <a href=http://scottmace.typepad.com/imanager/2004/02/cool_demo_rsa_r.html>Scott Mace</a> has a good description of the demo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each booth visitor selects from one of three demo prescriptions -- "tranquility pills," "wisdom pills," or "happiness pills." (I chose wisdom, naturally.) The RSA Labs crew requests a name from the visitor, then hands over an appropriately-tagged bottle (mine contained jellybeans). They scan the bottle on an RFID tabletop scanner and visitors see the details of the prescription, including type of prescription and patient's name. Then, they insert the bottle into an ordinary paper pharmacy bag that happens to contain a paper "blocker tag" that then blocks any attempt for an RFID reader to scan the bottle while it's in the bag.</blockquote><p>
Though a cool demo, I'm not as confident that this solution will work. Now in addition to the previous "foil bag" theft techniques, what prevents someone from building one of these into a watch or a PDA? Sending a signal to burn-out the RFID is one of the other proposals out there, it has similar problems -- what if someone goes into a WalMart and burns-out every RFID in the place?

<p>RSA was also demoing its latest SecurID integration with Windows, which will extend the life of this security token for RSA customers for many years. I spoke to Scott Schnell, VP of Marketing, afterwards at a party and he explained to me some of the details of how they made it work with Windows laptops. Apparently the system will cache up to several weeks worth of SecurID information such that the laptop owner can use his SecurID token to log on to his laptop even though he is not connected to the network. I neat trick, though I'd like to see some more security reviews before I'd deploy it broadly.</p>

<p>Probably the most interesting, but least useful to me, was a booth for <a href=http://www.magiqtech.com/>Magiq Technology</a>, who offer a commercial quantum cryptography solution. Quantum cryptography is the ultimate in secret key exchange at a distance -- you can sort of say that the universe protects you from snoopers. However, you have to have a fiber-optic connection between the two devices, which limits its practicality. But it is still cool.</p>
