	<title>Comments on Community by the Numbers, Part II: Personal Circles</title>
	<subtitle>In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; post, I talked about the limits on sizes of tightly-knit communities. These group limits are closely related to a number of interesting personal limits, and are often confused with them. Unlike the group limits, personal limits actually measure something different: the number of connections that an individual can hold. They&#39;re yet another thing that you must consider when thinking about communities of people.</subtitle>

Some are really risking to go out beyond circles to explore. And this what social networking can do. Thanks, great read!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just getting started reading your blog (first two articles of the By The Numbers series), and I&amp;#39;m very interested.  A few random reactions so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- You speak of &amp;quot;circles&amp;quot;, but you diagram spirals.  Would it be useful to recognize the differences and similarities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- In &amp;quot;Bowling Alone&amp;quot;, Robert Putnam speaks of two kinds of social capital: bonding (that holds groups together) and bridging (that relates a group to &amp;quot;others&amp;quot;).  Would this distinction be useful in your model(s)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I&amp;#39;ve got a tentative start at a project intended to explore all aspects of communities, in particular the aspects that affect a community&amp;#39;s health, resilience, and relationships to its environment (including other communities, of course).  See my URL from this comment.  I suspect I&amp;#39;ll be referencing your work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">&lt;p&gt;I like &amp;#39;circles&amp;#39;; a very useful contrast to groups where the members are interconnected and know each other. I usually think of this as the difference between &amp;#39;networks&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;communities&amp;#39; on a larger scale. Looking forward to the next article about power laws across larger communities; in particular, I&amp;#39;m curious what you think the Dunbar number and other descriptions about group interaction and stability have to say about the dynamics of large groups with a shared identity (like enthusiasts in a large online community or &amp;#39;offline&amp;#39; groups like labor unions, professional organizations or political parties).&lt;/p&gt;</content>
