	<title>Comments on Community by the Numbers, Part One: Group Thresholds</title>
	<subtitle>We often think of communities as organic creatures, which come into existence and grow on their own. However, the truth is they are fragile blossoms. Although many communities surely germinate and bloom on their own, purposefully creating communities can take a tremendous amount of hard work, and one factor their success ultimately depends upon is their numbers. (post continues with discussion of various ideal and non-ideal group size thresholds...)</subtitle>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of Quantum states of Electrons spinning around the nucleus. So, maybe different quantic numbers of persons generate different energy levels, apt for different services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as an analogy, if I recall well, when coming from an external path to an internal one allows the matter to shed light. So, maybe as we internalize we allow light to reach outward?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">&lt;p&gt;This view of group size dynamics has a lot of potential implications for all kinds of things including management science and more specifically/interesting to me startup dynamics. Namely, you&amp;#39;re proposing an outline that can be mapped to company size and funding levels, amounts of management required/deployable etc. Have you thought of making a stronger connection in this area?&lt;/p&gt;</content>
