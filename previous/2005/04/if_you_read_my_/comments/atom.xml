			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/04/if_you_read_my_.html">&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to see that your first del.icio.us posting linked to W. Ross Ashby&amp;#39;s An Introduction to Cybernetics. I devoured that book when it was first published in 1956, and I was a 28 year old ad copywriter. I worked through all the examples and laughed like mad over ex. 4/15, the letter which begins, &amp;quot;Dear Friend, some years ago I bought this old house, but found it to be haunted by two ghostly noises -- a ribald Singing and a sardonic Laughter ... &amp;quot;. I copied it out by hand and sent copies round my friends as an Xmas card that year. I don&amp;#39;t think any of them had the faintest idea what I was on about. I still have the sixth impression of that book beside me now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first acquaintance with the subject must have been with Norbert Wiener&amp;#39;s Cybernetics in 1948, while I was still an undergraduate. I understood little of it, but it did introduce me to Russell&amp;#39;s Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must add these to my own del.icio.us collection plus a couple of other books on symbolic logic, which deeply impressed me at the time. I&amp;#39;ve only just discovered your blog, through John Robb, and I will add your site to my own blog Junkyard Whirlwind. You have led me to a most interesting cluster of concepts, and must explore further. Many thanks.    &lt;/p&gt;</content>

I do the same thing on my blog, only with my Furl.net selections (similar tool, more options I think, more friendly UI).  I do use RSS Digest as well to run the del.icio.us/tag/wiki RSS feed on my blog. (Marshall&amp;#39;s New Web Tool Blog http://marshallk.blogspot.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy checking out the folks over at http://marketingstudies.net too.  They first alerted me to the possibility of using RSS like this, and though they are all about corporate marketing, they come up with many good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your blog, allways a pleasure to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of wikis (I see you intend to write about the editing dichotomy, great, have you checked out wikalong.org ?  It&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
