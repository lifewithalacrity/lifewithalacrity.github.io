	<title>Comments on Systems for Collective Choice</title>
	<subtitle>Collective choice systems have been around for a long time. Since at least the birth of democracy in ancient Greece people have made joint decisions about important issues, and since at least the knightly tournaments of the late Middle Age people have competed to be ranked against their peers. Today Western culture especially values diversity of input when implementing any type of choice, believing that wide input from a variety of people provides the fairest result. [post continues with discussion of different types of collective choice systems]</subtitle>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">&lt;p&gt;Will you cover, in a future post the forced choice vote? I&amp;#39;d welcome learning about more ways that a group can discuss alternatives (online or in person) then either vote in a priority way (first choice, second choice, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;
and/ or choose to vote in a first round for &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; number of options then limit the conversation to those options, then perhaps do a forced choice vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words what are some hybrid methods that you &lt;br /&gt;
(amazing) Christopher might craft that combine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Thoughtful conversation to hear all ideas/opinions - &lt;br /&gt;
without the downsides of :&lt;br /&gt;
• being prolonged to the point it pains participants&lt;br /&gt;
               and/or&lt;br /&gt;
• being dominated by one or two &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; or verbose personalities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; .....with &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Stages of voting closure that enable all participants &lt;br /&gt;
to see &amp;#39;we&amp;#39; are moving to the top choice(s) of the group&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - another fan of life with alacrity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. In addition to the aforementioned, brilliant, The Paradox of Choice, read Smart Choices by Howard Raiffa&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">&lt;p&gt;At least part of the reason why I didn&amp;#39;t strongly highlight markets is that the definition of &amp;quot;collective choice&amp;quot;, at least as far as how many academics use it, is all the methods that groups make decisions EXCEPT markets. For instance, from http://www.bsos.umd.edu/umccc/ &amp;quot;models of individual rational choice behavior to study non-market social phenomena&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, another definition is http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~polisci/calvert/PolSci505/ &amp;quot;social choice theory and noncooperative game theory&amp;quot;, and I might say that markets fall into a subset of noncooperative game theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I&amp;#39;m not sure why most academics exclude markets, thus I do briefly mention the Stock Market as a subcategory of comparison system. I hope to mention them more in other future articles, in particular, prediction markets as a subcategory of Polling Systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">&lt;p&gt;I agree this is a very interesting article!  I notice an (intentional?) lack of coverage of most of the dominant and mature decision-making institutions in our society: markets in general (and specifically institutions such as exchanges -- mentioned briefly -- auctions, fixed-price retail stores vs. haggling bazaars, and so on), risk sharing institutions (e.g. insurance), hierarchical organizations based on the employer-employee and boss-subordinate relationships, the judiciary based on written law, opinion, and precedent, and so on.  Of course, it would be very ambitious to tackle these, but it would at least be interesting to try to categorize them according to your taxonomy.  Perhaps they are so complex they often fall into multiple categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The systems you describe abstract a vast amount of diffuse and often tacit information pertinent to a decision into a numerical result. Most economists (particularly Austrian school) would argue that at least on a large scale prices generated by auctions and exchanges generally do this better than other collective decision making systems.  On the other hand, many systems for collective choice don&amp;#39;t work via an abstract numerical intermediary (e.g. the opinion and precedent system of the judiciary). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that the most important factor in these institutions is the costs involved in eliciting diffuse knowledge and lossily compressing it into a decision which is hopefully nevertheless a reasonably accurate reflection of that diffuse information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

It provides a great description of some of the other challenges of multi-party elections.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to suggest one small correction to the description of Condorcet voting, which says &amp;quot;it is much harder on the voters, who have to rank every single candidate&amp;quot;.  In a Condorcet system, the voters don&amp;#39;t have to rank every candidate; they can rank as many or as few as they want (just like IRV), and they can even rank candidates equally (unlike IRV).  The Wikipedia article entitled &amp;quot;Condorcet method&amp;quot; describes this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding a comparison of these systems, i&amp;#39;ve tried to illustrate the behaviour of plurality, approval, IRV, and Condorcet elections at http://zesty.ca/voting/ , and i hope you will find my method and results interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Would &amp;quot;information futures market&amp;quot; or the like be a Delphic system? It sure seems more like a consensus measuring device to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting things about all of these systems is the side effects they have on the decisions made. Binary Votes polorize options. Information Futures Markets encourage results manipulation (by design!)&lt;br /&gt;

Both consensus methods and facilitated decision making processes fall under the &amp;quot;deliberation systems&amp;quot; category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my hope in future articles to dig deeper into each broad category and show more examples of types. Next week hopefully will be comparison rating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
