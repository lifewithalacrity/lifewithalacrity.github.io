	<title>Comments on Ratings: Who Do You Trust?</title>
	<subtitle>My colleague, Shannon Appelcline, has been working on a game rating system for RPGnet. This has resulted in some real-world applications for the rating systems which we&#39;ve previously discussed in our Collective Choice articles. Shannon&#39;s newest article, Ratings, Who Do You Trust? offers a look at weighting ratings based on reliability.</subtitle>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2006/09/ratings_who_do_.html">&lt;p&gt;My first pass system just used a different multiplier for weight based on the type of content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1x for just a raw rating&lt;br /&gt;
2x for a rating with a non-blank comment&lt;br /&gt;
5x for a review (which goes through a different, approved content system)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second pass system also included &amp;quot;volume of ratings by user&amp;quot; and thus applied a variable multiplier depending on how many ratings the user has made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(0-2x) for a raw rating&lt;br /&gt;
2x(0-2x) for a rating with comment&lt;br /&gt;
5x for a review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 0-2x is calculated as (# of ratings by user)/50, to 2 max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that the core weighting system by depth is producing better results, though I haven&amp;#39;t done any studies of that yet. The additional weighting for volume by users has definitely prevented bias by hit-and-run raters who just stop by to rate one game that they&amp;#39;ve been asked to.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Can you explain with more detail how the rating by depth of content is generated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking through the other articles, so hopefully I find the info there.&lt;/p&gt;
