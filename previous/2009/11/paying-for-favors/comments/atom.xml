	<title>Comments on Paying for Favors</title>
	<subtitle>One of the common practices in the independent movie industry is to share favors to keep production costs low. I loan you use of a camera and you later do some editing for me on the cheap. Of course, it is often actually less direct then that: I loan you the camera, the community knows that I am generous, and when I need some editing time on the cheap, my social capital in the film community makes the resource available to me. [post continues with quote from Joss Whedon and some commentary]...</subtitle>
