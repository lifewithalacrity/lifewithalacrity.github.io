	<title>Comments on Facilitating Small Gatherings Using &quot;The Braid&quot;</title>
	<subtitle>[intro skipped] One tool that I&#39;ve used to manage these odd-sized groups in the past is what I call “The Braid”. It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which The World Café and Conversation Café are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called Cafe To Go. [rest of post continues with more details on The Braid...]</subtitle>
