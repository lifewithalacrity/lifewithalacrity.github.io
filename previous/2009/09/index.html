                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/bank_book.htm style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c-320wi alt="Power of Conversation" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c "></a> I was musing as I was preparing for next week's Intensive at <a href=teaching-using-the-social-web-for-social-change-at-bgiedu.html>BGI</a> that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That's because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.</p>

<p>I talk about this a bit in my <a href=../../2008/09/group-threshold.html>Group Threshold</a> and <a href=../../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>Dunbar Number</a> posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the <a href=../../2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number>“Judas Number”</a> nadir, or low point. These group threshold nadirs exist when groups are too large for some processes to function effectively, but too small for others to work.</p>

<p>I am particularly aware of this threshold when I host small parties at my home. At 7 or so people everything just seems to work — conversations flow, everybody gets to participate, and everyone has fun. A the numbers climb past 10 I find that I as the host have to work harder, to be more aware of making sure that everyone is having a good time and that no one is left out. At some point as a party gets larger things just begin to flow again, as there are enough people that small groups can form and conversation flows well once more.</p>

<p>I've also seen this at business meetings. When my entrepreneurial companies were small an “all hands” meeting could be incredibly effective. All the issues and ideas got brought up, and everyone felt committed to our decisions. However, as these meeting grew, at some point the “all hands” meeting took too long and started requiring process and rules to be effective. The energy this consumed also diminished much of the efficacy of the meeting.</p>

<p><a href=../../files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border=1" title="Four Table Braid"><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2434/3959741597_77ffe2ca15_m.jpg alt="Four Table Braid" height=137 style="border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: black; border-right-color: black; border-bottom-color: black; border-left-color: black; " width=240 title="Card from Four Table Braid"></a>One tool that I've used to manage these odd-sized groups in the past is what I call “The Braid”. It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which <a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/>The World Café</a> and <a href=""></a><a href=http://www.conversationcafe.org/>Conversation Café</a> are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called <a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/articles/cafetogo.pdf>Cafe To Go</a>.</p>

<p>The Braid is a little more organized then the more ad-hoc Café Method. When you start a meeting you are given a small card that tells you which table to sit at for each round. Each table is assigned a scribe for each round to take notes at the table, and to report out the notes to everyone who arrives for the next round.</p>

<p>One nice thing about the organization of The Braid is that over the course of a number of rounds you'll have a brand new group of people to talk to during each round. Thus over the course of an hour or so you'll actually get to have a relatively short yet rich conversation with almost everyone in the room, rather than with just a few.</p>

<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Four Table Braid"><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/3960601974_652a29b96f.jpg alt="Four Table Braid" height=453 width=433></a> There are different forms of The Braid for different numbers of tables and sizes of groups, but my favorite is the Four Table Braid for groups of a minimum of 16 to a maximum of 28 people. One of the peculiar things about this Braid is that it seems to function well if people arrive at different times. The Braid fills first table A with 4 people so that they can begin talking, then fills table B, C, and D the same way. Once those tables are full, new arrivals are woven into The Braid one at a time until all tables have 5 people, then 6, then the max of 7 for a total of 28 people.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about the Four Table Braid is that no one needs to be the scribe more then once; the task is equally shared among all but the last 8 to arrive in a group of 28. Also, in just 4 rounds with 16 people, 90%+ of the participants have met. With 28 people, you simply only need 5 rounds to match the same 90%+ meeting percentage.</p>

<p>I find The Braid useful for a variety of different situations. The simplest usage is as a group warming and introduction exercise. You need not do more then two or three rounds in order for more than half of the people to have met each other. The Braid is also useful with a focused objective. For instance, I once used it after a game designers' conference, with each table having a list of "game design laws" where the participants were asked to either give an example that was in favor of the law or contradicted the law. It also can be useful in combination with a variety of other group process techniques, for instance after an MG Taylor Take-A-Panel, where each participant first creates a page telling a story about themselves 15 years in the future and then the group uses The Braid to discover common insights. The Braid can also be good before an Open Space or other unconference event.</p>

<p>I am including here my templates for a <a href=../../files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf>Four Table Braid</a>. It includes 28 cards for printing on Avery business card paper, 4 table pages with instructions for participants, and 1 page with instructions for the host. I make these available as <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/ rel=license>CC-BY-NC-SA</a> license. I welcome any DTP folks out there who would like to make these documents more functional or more attractive.</p>

<p>A Three Table Braid is easy to figure out by hand, but larger Braids are more difficult. I've never figured out an algorithm for designing these quickly (any math wizzes out there?) so I've posted my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0">spreadsheet</a> for the Four Table Braid for those of you who might wish to figure out how to implement larger numbers of tables. I would love to have a Ten Table Braid as a warm up exercise for a small unconference.</p>

                                <p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/13957977@N02/2460905893/ style="float: right;" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank','scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2136/2460905893_0c3fc213c5_m.jpg alt="Key in Door" title="Key in Door" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 1px; "></a>Passwords are very important for maintaining your online identity, because they ensure that no one else can access your accounts and do things that you wouldn't do. As such, you should make sure that your online passwords are as strong as possible. This article will provide some general guidelines for doing so.</p>

<h3>Multiple Passwords</h3>

<p>Note that I said that you want to ensure your passwords, plural, are strong. That's because you'll want at least two. They should both be good passwords, but they should be used in different places.</p>

<p>Use a “non-secure” password for any non-financial websites that you sign up for, such as Facebook and Twitter. Use a different “secure” password for places where your credit card is on file or money changes hands, such as eBay, Amazon, your bank, and your stock broker. Because banks and other financial institutions are more likely to maintain good security over their transactions, reserving a password only for those sites makes it more likely that they will remain safe.</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be the tip of the iceberg. You might want to create a third password for shopping sites, or another one for less reliable sites that you might use. Ideally you would use a different password for every site. That would surely be the most secure, as someone breaking into one site couldn't get into your other accounts — but clearly that is too many passwords to remember. As a compromise, I'll talk shortly about an easy technique to both remember and vary your passwords.</p>

<h3>Criteria for Bad Passwords</h3>

<p>In a moment, I'm going to suggest an excellent method for creating a secure password. However, if you prefer to use your own methods, be sure to watch out for these common problems which could result weak passwords.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use obvious words. There was a time when “password” was one of the most common passwords on the internet (along with “root” and “”).
</li>
<li>Do not use words from the dictionary as passwords. Some of the oldest password crackers just dumped the entire dictionary at an account to see if any of them worked as passwords. This doesn't apply just to English either. It's easy enough for a password cracker to use any dictionary, whether it be French or Klingon.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on a dictionary word with simple substitutions. Though I'll talk in a bit about the advantage of substituting letters for numbers, a dictionary word with simple substitutions will be no more secure than just a dictionary word. That's because later password crackers would run not only the dictionary, but also a dictionary with a few substitutions, such as “0”s for “o”s and “1”s for “l”s.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on multiple dictionary words concatenated together. If you were concatenating three or four words, you might be OK, but password crackers were checking two word dictionary concatenations a decade ago.
</li>
<li>Do not use obvious names of people or places you know. Your girlfriend's name, your street address, and your favorite pet's name are all straight out. A password cracker may not be able to guess these (though testing against common names is another strategy used by some), but if someone who knows you can break in by hand, that's no good either.
</li>
<li>Do not write down your password, and especially do not write down your password in an online or computer file. If you picked the best password in the world, it doesn't matter if someone else can easily look at it.
</li>
<li>Do not keep the same password forever. It's pain, but you really should change it every year or two, at least, just in case someone has broken into one of your accounts, and you don't know it.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>A Method for Creating a Strong Password</h3>

<p>So you've learned a lot about what makes a bad password. What makes a good password? The following suggests one method that you can use to create a password that's not easily breakable — but which is easily memorable.
</p>

<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3952128651/ style="float: right;" title="Safari by ChristopherA, on Flickr" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank','scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img height=500 src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3952128651_b6842a0ecf.jpg alt="Password Meter" title="Password Meter" width=363></a>

<ol>
<li>Pick a short phrase, or an obscure but memorable long word. For example “amber waves” or “perspicacious”.
</li>
<li>Shorten it to 7 characters, such as “ambrwvs” or “prspccus”.
</li>
<li>Convert a letter other then first to a number. You can use those obvious substitutions here (e.g., A=4, B=8, E=3, G=6, I=1, L=1, O=0, R=2, S=5, T=7), since they're not your only method of security. This might produce “ambrwv5” or “pr5pccus”.
</li>
<li>The next part is the key trick: use a specific letter from the domain name for the last character for your password and capitalize it. For example, you might add the third o from google, producing “ambrwv5O” or “pr5pccusO” for a GMail password. This ensures that even if
you use your password at multiple sites, anyone who steals the password can't use it another website unless they know the trick. You can also use this trick with your computer's password by choosing the third letter from the name you use for the computer, or for a password required for a software application, by using the third letter from the app's name.
</li>
<li>You should check the quality of your example password at <a href=http://www.passwordmeter.com/>Password Meter</a> -- “ambrwv5O” weight is 54%, which is pretty good for an 8-character password, “pr5pccusO” is 44%, which is OK, but both are significantly better because they will be different at every site.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The same technique can be used with longer words to create more secure financial passwords. These might be easier to remember if you use the first letters from a sentence or poem that you can remember to generate the initial phrase. For example, “My first pet's name was Arthur the Valiant Dog” would generate “MfpnwAtVD”. Again, you convert one or more letters to a number (“Mfpnw4tVD”). </p>

<p>When you add the domain letters to your secure password, you can strengthen it again by adding multiple letters, possibly to different parts of the password. For example, add the first and last letter the domain name. Thus a Google Gmail password might add a “G” to start and an “E” to the end, producing “GMfpnw4tVDE”. This one rates 70% at Password Meter, but again is actually better because of the site variation.<p>Also, most financial sites will accept, and some even require, passwords to include a symbol — I don't recommend this with your “non-secure” password as many ordinary sites do not allow symbols, but if you need one, then the following are some easy to remember substitutions: A=@, E=#, I=!, L=!, O=* S=$, or you can just put a symbol between the first domain letter and the passphrase (many sites will not allow a symbol at beginning or end). For example, password above could become “G$Mfpnw4tVDE” which raises this password's Password Meter rating to 90%.<p>With these two passwords you'll find it very easy to both remember and be secure against most password based attacks.</p>

<h3>A High-Tech Alternative</h3>

<p>An interesting high-security alternative that works best on webpages is to use <a href=http://supergenpass.com/>SuperGenPass Bookmarklet</a> — it takes the domain name plus a private master password and creates a unique high security password for each website based on a cryptographic hash of the two. It
can generate any length of password and you can't really get a password that is more secure, but there is the occasional web page that the bookmarklet doesn't work on. Fortunately, you can save <a href=http://supergenpass.com/mobile/>http://supergenpass.com/mobile/</a> as an .html file to your disk and you can open it anytime to manually create a supergenpass password for a website that you can copy and paste. I've even used SuperGenPass on my iPhone.</p>

<h3>Secondary Authentication</h3>

<p>Many sites require you to give them additional identification, such as mother's maiden name, the name of your pet, etc. Crackers have broken
into various celebrities accounts — such as Paris Hilton and Sarah Palin — by researching this information and asking for a password reset.</p>

<p>You can avoid this danger by treating these authentication requests like passwords. I have a standard word that I use for my mother's maiden name, my pet, etc. They're things that I can easily remember, but no one could figure out. Like the password technique above, I can easily add a letter from the domain. I've had no problem with customer service phone calls to banks; when they ask me for my mother's maiden name I just spell it out my encode word for them.</p>

<h3>Be Safe</h3>

<p>None of these approaches is perfect, but they significantly raise the bar against any but the most determined cracker from breaking into one
of your accounts. The domain letter technique will also make it very difficult for a cracker to break into your more important financial accounts if he gets access to your password from a poorly secured website or masquerades as a legitimate website or email by using a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing>phishing</a> attack.</p>

<p>However, don't ever think that a good password is the be-all and end-all of security. You also have to protect it adequately, and that doesn't just mean not writing it down, as mentioned above. You also must be alert to “social engineering”, where a cracker might call you or email you pretending to be associated with some institute where you might have an account.</p>

<p>Security is a constant game of oneupmanship between you and the black hats. Thus you need to ensure that you're always alert to the current best practices for setting, resetting, and protecting all of your security information on the internet.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href="http://worldatuningfork.com/John/medusaosxPDF.pdf#page=203" style="float: left;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577a68d970b-800wi alt="Poem: Language" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577a68d970b " border=0 title="Poem: Language"></a>We live in a world of conversation, of language; all full of words. Mastery of language requires learning the meanings of thousands of words. The average native English language speaker uses in the realm of 12,000 to 20,000 words, whereas a college graduate would use 20-25,000 words. Shakespeare actively used more then 30,000 words, and his vocabulary was estimated to be over 66,000 words. Yet there are, at the very least, a quarter of a million distinct English words, excluding inflections, and words from technical and regional vocabularies. The Oxford English dictionary defines more then 600,000 words.</p>

<p>But mastery of words is not enough to allow effective conversation.</p>

<p>That is because words themselves don't have meaning; the meaning is provided by the people who use them. Meaning is in the mind, not in the words.</p>

<p>Words also require context, outside of which they may have different meanings. For instance, consider the word "trust". To a banker or CPA "trust" is a property held by someone to manage for someone else's benefit. To a cryptographer it is the confidence in a future outcome based on probabilistic mathematics and past experience. Finally, to the lay person "trust" is about honesty. "Spin" is another example of a word that changes with context; to a weaver it is the production of thread, to a physicist it is a property of elemental particles, to an athlete it is a type of exercise class, and to a politician or public relations professional it is a way to tell a story to sway pubic opinion.</p>

<h4>Creating a Shared Language</h4>

<p></p>

<p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b-pi style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b-320pi alt="Life With Alacrity Wordle" title="Life With Alacrity Wordle" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b " style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language. They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience.</p>

<p>Don't forget that the linguistic root of communication is the Latin verb <a href=http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.18:3557.lewshort title="Latin definition of commūnĭco">commūnĭco</a>  — which doesn't mean "to communicate" but instead means "to share something with someone, to take or receive a part of, to partake, to participate in". Thus the creation of a shared language takes us to the roots of communication.</p>

<p>Without taking the time time to create shared language, groups have a difficult time forging mutual trust. Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something. Without a shared language commitments can be hard to make, and if misunderstood can lead to disagreements. These group formation phases — trust building, goal clarification, and commitment — are essential.</p>

<p>Yet the art of creating a shared language together is not taught. Some individuals and groups do it intuitively while others will just let it evolve naturally over time. However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact.</p>

<h4>Using Shared Artifacts</h4>

<p>A shared artifact is the creation of an object or shared space that is created collaboratively. It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: "Is this what you mean when you are talking about this? I use these words, so suppose we change it to this? Is that what you mean? Does this reflect our new shared understanding?"</p>

<p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c-pi style="float: left;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c-120pi alt=WatsonCrick title=WatsonCrick class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c " style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;"></a><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c-pi style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c-120wi alt=Napkin-idea-original-concept-300x293 class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c " style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a> Examples of shared artifacts include Watson &amp; Crick's Tinker-Toy DNA model. Each scientist would work on the model separately, then use grad students to carry the model around to his partner to express certain ideas. Both Compaq Computer and Southwest Airlines were reportedly established after their founders wrote their ideas down together on a table napkin, another shared artifact.</p>

<p>Both of these examples show an important factor in shared artifacts — if the shared artifact is not constrained then it will be too large or complex for the group to reach some measure of completion. Finishing the shared artifact really helps establish trust and the connections between the participants.</p>

<p>A shared artifact is also useful because flooding someone with information and terms gives no assurance that the recipient has gained knowledge of the subject. Instead, the act of creation confirms to both parties that the knowledge was successfully assimilated.</p>

<p>Another advantage to creating a shared artifact is that it isolates any problems to the task at hand. Often there are differences in status, purpose, or perspective that can get in the way of group formation, but a focus on a common task of the creation of a neutral shared artifact allows those issues to come later as the participants develop the trust and shared language required to talk about those tough issues.</p>

<p>The best facilitators know what kinds of shared artifacts work best for different groups under different circumstances. Sometimes a shared artifact is just a model of a process drawn on a white wall. Often it is a creation of a mission statement or joint objectives. I personally like taking old mind maps and trying to recreate them anew with more recent knowledge.</p>

<h4>The Future of Shared Language</h4>

<p>The nature of shared language is changing in the 21st century. The conjoined social networks in the blogosphere — via Facebook, Twitter, or the attendee-focused Unconference — cause new terminology and new language to form ever faster. I've personally seen words like "retweet" and "attribution" gain important contextual meaning within my social networks. As with any shared language, newcomers have difficulty discovering their meanings only by osmosis.</p>

<p>Tagging is another means by which shared language is rapidly expanding. Certain words are gaining context through common use at Delicious.com, Technorati, Flickr, and other tag-enabled web sites.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, all of these new shared languages are built upon shared artifacts. Twitter, Facebook, Delicious.com and others sites each create constraints on how language is shared and with whom. However, there is little purposeful social design being applied to these new shared languages. Though there may be shared artifacts, they are not purposefully facilitated.</p>

<p>Will these increasingly organic shared languages prove better than more purposefully created ones or worse? Is social language facilitation the next big thing in social network? Or is there just not enough space for it within the tightly constrained social artifacts of the internet? These are questions that we as social software technologists need to address as the future of the internet increasingly becomes the present of our social groupings.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>(I learned the concept of Shared Language in 1990 from Michael Schrage's book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Shared-Minds-New-Technologies-Collaboration/dp/0394565878>Shared Minds: The New Technologies of Collaboration</a>. It is out of print, but there is a new edition retitled <a href=http://www.amazon.com/No-More-Teams-Mastering-Collaboration/dp/0385476035/>No More Teams!: Mastering the Dynamics of Creative Collaboration</a>. The use of a <a href=http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/glasbead/modexpl.htm>modeling language</a> to facilitate group formation I learned from <a href=http://www.matttaylor.com>Matt Taylor</a> (<a href=http://twitter.com/worthyprojects>@worthyprojects</a>) of <a href=http://www.mgtaylor.com/>MG Taylor Corporation</a>, though the use of the term shared artifacts and approach is my own. I make passing reference to the early stages of team formation ("trust building", "goal clarification", "commitment") which come from the <a href=http://www.grove.com/site/ourwk_gm_tp.html>Drexler/Sibbet Team Peformance Model</a>. The poem is by excerpt of a larger work by <a href=http://worldatuningfork.com/John/>John Campion</a> and is reprinted with permission — the work reflects the poet's Ecotropic concerns and are part of his third
book-length poem Medusa. Look at the work under the Medusa Project link. The table napkin photo is from an excellent post on <a href="http://createtheconditions.com/?p=304">The Idea Napkin</a> by Morry Potoka and is also reprinted with permission. The Watson-Crick photo is public domain, and the Life With Alacrity graphic was produced using <a href=http://www.wordle.net/>Wordle</a>.)</em></p>

                                <p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a57769f5970b-pi style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a57769f5970b-800wi alt="Bgiedu seal 248x248" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a57769f5970b " border=0 title="Bgiedu seal 248x248"></a> Starting next week I will be teaching a course at the Bainbridge Graduate Institute on the topic of "Using the Social Web for Social Change".</p>

<p></p>
BGI offers an MBA and Certificate program for professionals to learn how to build enterprises that are financially successful, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. Students have to learn everything that they'd have to learn in an ordinary MBA program — profit and loss, how to read a balance sheet, business plan creation, macroeconomics, quantitative analysis, corporate strategy, how to manage and motivate people, and a basic understanding of all the components of business such as operations, marketing, distribution, sales, etc. In addition, BGI student have to learn green and sustainability topics — the triple-bottom line, environmental accounting, sustainable energy, social justice, systems thinking, organization change, right livelihood and much more.<p></p>
That broad a curriculum doesn't give students a lot of room for electives, but the MBA program allows for students to take one 3 credit hour course. This year students can choose from three: one course on social responsibility, a second course on climate change and carbon trading, and my course on the social web.<p></p>
The BGI pedagogy (a new term I have just learned, meaning "teaching method") is a mixed hybrid of online sessions along with a number of very intensive in-person classroom sessions. This allows the MBA student to continue working while taking classes in either a 2-year or 3-year program.<p></p><a href=http://www.channelrock.ca/ style="float: left;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5cdf579970c-120wi alt="The Cobb House at Channel Rock" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5cdf579970c " style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;"></a><a href=http://www.islandwood.org/ style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5776c2e970b-120wi alt="The IslandWood Main Hall" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5776c2e970b " style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a> Students kick off their BGI experience at <a href=http://www.channelrock.ca/>Channel Rock</a> on Cortes Island in British Columbia, where the live for a week at an off-the-grid wilderness retreat, where they get the chance to experience and practice sustainability. Over the course of the year students and faculty meet in intensive classroom sessions for a 4-day weekend once a month at the  <a href=http://www.islandwood.org/>IslandWood</a> environmental learning center on <a href=http://www.bainbridgechamber.com/>Bainbridge Island</a> near Seattle, Washington. Between sessions, the classes utilize a variety of online distance-learning technologies such as <a href=http://www.elluminate.com/>Elluminate</a> to support student learning.<p></p>
I like this hybrid format because it fits my ideals of group formation — bonding and team building work best in the immersive, in-person experience, yet the online technologies allow students to have greater flexibility, deeper focus, and more control over their engagement while remote. BGI offers students both.<p></p>
When the class is complete, I plan to offer the syllabus, course plan, presentations, etc. online as open courseware, so that other schools can use these materials as a basis for future classes. In the meantime, expect to see some more posts here over the next few months.<p></p>

                                <p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5c52eae970c-pi style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5c52eae970c-120pi alt=Creative-commons-non-commercial title=Creative-commons-non-commercial class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5c52eae970c " style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a> Last year I participated in a survey followed up by a focus group on the topic of Noncommercial Use, in particular around the context that about 2/3rds of the <a href=http://creativecommons.org>Creative Commons</a> licenses extant use the NC attribute, such as in <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/>CC-BY-NC</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Defining "Noncommercial":  A Study of how the Online Population Understands "Noncommercial" Use</strong><br><a href=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Defining_Noncommercial style="color: #2a5db0; " target=_blank>http://wiki.<wbr></wbr>creativecommons.org/Defining_<wbr></wbr>Noncommercial</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The topic is somewhat of a sticky one, as there are many competing interests. There are content creators who wish to profit from their work, there are other content creators who don't want anyone to profit (even themselves), and of course there are content creators who want everything to be free provided you share free content back.</p>

<p>There also is not agreement on what noncommerical means. There are some clearly commercial uses, but there are also various type advertising and sponsorship and use by non-profit or education institutions where money changes hands (such as a card at a museum gift shop). Finally, there is use in news or criticism where users feel that they are not restricted due to the rules of fair-use.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that there is anything definitely "new" in this report, but there is some consensus and some interesting facts:</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The vast majority (73%) of creators define “commercial use” as a use where money is made, 76% of content users agreed.</li>
<li>33% of content users thought that individual use was noncommercial use, whereas only 19% of the content creators believed so.</li>
<li>Content creators rate uses by individuals as being less commercial (89%) – unless the user is a professional who earns money (35%)</li>
<li>13% of content users thought that fun, enjoyment, entertainment and artistic use was noncommercial use, whereas only 3% of content creators believed so.</li>
<li>52% of the content creators don't believe that content users understand the noncommercial provision, and 43% believe that content users don't respect the term.</li>
<li>50% of the content creators have been contacted about licensing their noncommercial content, 24% of the content creators have attempted to contact another creator about appropriate use of a CC license.</li>
<li>There is a lack of agreement on a lot of edge cases of noncommercial use. For instance, some feel cost-recovery is acceptable noncommercial use, money exchanged hands for a charitable use would be noncommercial, or use by a for-profit company where no money changed hands would still be noncommercial.</li>
<li>There is some interesting analysis of what people might be willing to change their mind about. For instance, before focus group participation only 8% thought that use for charitable purposes for social good would be noncommercial, but after the focus group 17% did.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all an excellent report, with lots of good data in it for further investigation. If you are involved in user-generated content, offer users creative-commons licenses, or are a consumer or provider of commercial content online, I recommend you take the time to understand these issues more deeply.</p>

<p>My personal take on this report is that the noncommercial provisions of the CC license need more clarification and there needs to be more user education. In addition I feel that Creative Commons also needs to look at the commercial use side of the problem. I appreciate the recent efforts toward a <a href=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus>CC Plus</a> metadata, but it isn't enough.

</p>

<p><a href=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/File:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png title=Image:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png class=image><img border=0 src=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/4/49/Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png alt=Image:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png height=31 width=88></a> <span style="font-size: 280%">+</span> <a href=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/File:Commercial-license-button.png title=Image:Commercial-license-button.png class=image><img border=0 src=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/9/91/Commercial-license-button.png alt=Image:Commercial-license-button.png height=31 width=88></a></p> 

For instance Creative Commons should take a principled stand on what exactly "fair use" is; make it easier for those who offer NC licenses to also offer a standard commercial license for common uses; and possibly creating a standard for what "fair rights" are in commercial license (i.e. fair to both the content creator and the content user).<p></p>

<p>There are also problems in the area of attribution, as all Creative Commons licenses except Public Domain have the BY provision. These get particularly difficult when you have a remix of content from many creators. There's also difficulty in the fact that it's not stated what places attribution must be listed in. For instance, can you do a movie or a podcast with remixed content, but have the attribution credits be a link? Or must they be credits in the media itself?<p>All are interesting problems that I hope Creative Commons will address in the future.</p>
