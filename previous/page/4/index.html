			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>This fall with be the 4th year, and the 5th time that I've taught the class <a href=http://www.bgi.edu/changing-business/social-web-for-social-change/ style="font-size: 10pt;" target=_self>Using the Social Web for Social Change</a> (hashtag #SW4SX) in the <a href=http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/hybrid-mba/ style="font-size: 10pt;" target=_self>MBA in Sustainable Systems</a> program at <a href=http://www.bgi.edu style="font-size: 10pt;" target=_self>Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a> (BGI.edu).</p>
<p>The class itself is an elective, but has become so popular that during this school year I am running the class three times: once this summer, again this fall, and a third time in the spring. This class is unique because it crosses class cohorts; it has also been available to members of the Seattle <a href=http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/metro-mba/ target=_self>Metro MBA</a> program; is the most popular class for auditing and alumni participation; and we have even had some faculty and TAs take the course. This means that we get a genuine cross-section of BGI and it has been a real inspiration and positive influence on the broader community and on other classes in the program.</p>
<p>The class itself is delivered in a hybrid (sometimes called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning target=_self>blended</a>) format — that is that we meet face-to-face on three different weekends for 6 hours each time over the course of a quarter. Supplementing those sessions, we meet online weekly in a synchronous chat room hosted by <a href=http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx target=_self>Blackboard Collaborate</a>. In addition to being part of a hybrid program, my personal goal is for the class to be a completely <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching target=_self>flipped classroom</a>, i.e. we reserve both face-to-face time AND our synchronous time in Collaborate for exercises, keeping lectures to a minimum. If I find myself lecturing, I try to record it so that in the next version of the course we can move the lecture into the readings.</p>
<p>This year is the first year that all MBA students are required to have iPads in the classroom. For many classes this will be mostly for electronic books, but in my class we will be using them for research, collaboration, social media, social networking and much more.</p>
<p>I have always intended the course content to be publically available, but I have just not had the time to massage it to the quality level that I was satisfied with. This year I have two TAs, whose assistance allows me to devote more time to making some of this material available to the public.</p>
<p>All of my course content is available under a Creative Commons <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ target=_self>Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike</a> license.</p>
<p>Here is the official syllabus for this fall's class:</p>
<h2>Using the Social Web for Social Change</h2>
<p><strong>Course Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This course will focus on using the latest social online tools to effect social change. The course will incorporate technical and practical aspects of the social web, as well as critical discussion of the latest theories on how to effectively influence change using social web technologies.  Students will leave the class being comfortable creating a persuasive social web site or a social video on a sustainability topic, using either computer based or tablet based tools. </p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the new and helpful tools available to them in the tool chest of open technologies called Web 2.0. Students will receive both a practical and a theoretical grounding in social networking, leading and participating in virtual teams, integrating the web into marketing efforts, and using the web to support social change. Students will use both computers and tablets for the duration of this course and will learn new and helpful tools specific to each device.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)/Co-requisite(s)</strong></p>
<p>First year of the BGI MBA program</p>
<p><strong>Instructional Contact Hours/Credits</strong> </p>
<p>3 credit hours</p>
<p>Please note that for every credit hour there will be a minimum of 10 synchronous contact hours (face to face and/or virtual session hours). Students should expect at least 2 hours of asynchronous learning (readings, written assignments, group activities) for every synchronous contact hour in this course. </p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the course, students will have demonstrated the following knowledge and abilities:</p>
<p>●	Gain basic familiarity of using Social Web within a professional context<br>●	Speak authentically online with a practiced proficiency using a variety of online mediums and have a mastery of least one medium<br>●	Have a practiced proficiency in creating projects using Social Web tools that measurably effect social change</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>Over my lifetime I have encountered a number of “tools for ignition” — a phrase which I use to describe innovative products that have empowered people and created movements. On the 25th anniversary of Hypercard’s introduction, I want to take a look back at some of these tools.</p>
<h2>BASIC (1976)</h2>
<p>In 1976 I encountered my first tool for ignition: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates>Bill Gate's</a> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSAI_8080>MicroSoft BASIC</a> running on the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSAI_8080>IMSAI 8080</a>. There was no ROM on this computer, so you had to load a boot program using the front panel switches you see above. This program would then allow us to use a paper-tape reader, from which we would load BASIC.</p>
<p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2hMUDycBGPQ3z3AM1rBtQw5J5-xDS9vNnaBZEbJf0G_GyROnc2pvxi0zCxLwxYH5jc3NTeD0gi3nbCnuq516Qzq4b1mqarsVDLAZaenIW0aPmtN6-JQ alt="" height=310px; width=540px;></p>
<p>At 15 it wasn't the hardware that got me excited, it was the idea of software — that you could take a creative idea that was in your mind and then craft that idea into a reality.</p>
<p>My passion of the moment was French (the daughter of my French teacher was quite cute), so my first program was an attempt to teach my computer to translate between French to English.</p>
<p>Alas, I utterly failed in my first attempt, limited by the 4K RAM, and I had no more luck working in 8K. But my failure didn't matter in the long term — it inspired a career creating tools that nurture creative passions.</p>
<h2>BBS (1978)</h2>
<p>My next experience with a tool for ignition was <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Christensen>Ward Christensen's</a> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBBS>CBBS</a>, the first electronic bulletin board system. Within months of its release in 1978, there were BBSs sprouting up all over the United States. I dialed a long-distance number, logged into a BBS, and discovered many passionate people wanting to share their experience — not only computer, but life. For the first time, I experienced computer software as a tool for human interaction, not only as a utility for running a program.</p>
<p>By this point I was working after school part-time in a microcomputer store, so I scavenged up an old S100 computer and a used modem and made available a small BBS in my hometown. No longer having to pay long-distance charges, at 17 I found myself at the center of an online community. This experience proved invaluable — indeed, today I credit my success to the skills I acquired in facilitating online conversations and growing communities that share common interests.</p>
<h2>MacPaint (1984)</h2>
<p>Six years passed, and personal computers started to become more common in people’s workplaces and homes. Unlike the IMSAI 8080, they now had screens and keyboards, and they made great text processors and data crunchers, but they weren’t particularly “sexy”. On January 24, 1984, the first Mac was released, and I dropped into my local computer store to see what it was all about. The original 128K Mac was “different”, as Apple’s later marketing campaign put it, but also clunky in appearance.</p>
<p>However, my jaw dropped when I saw Bill Atkinson's (MacPaint) [<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint</a>]. The simple elegance of this software that allowed me to draw and express myself graphically on a computer screen with a mouse was what sold me on the Mac, not the hardware.</p>
<p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fg9RtUixZeDKNeftTruklS0XPfhlwgQigeysrEooKC06H8mD4BYUFr16CvUtnCTGV5XGPv2zr_I5GPiOSV9uvM3riaLE6DvDTWTdRC1wHZ20Ag-BEvw alt="" height=375px; width=500px;></p>
<p>By this point, I was making my living doing software development. I wasn't an artist myself, but I dropped everything to hire some artist friends to start drawing on the Mac. I would start a clip-art company, I thought, not knowing that too many other people had the same idea. So I considered how I could build on my prior experience with computers and take advantage of this new platform. I wrote a bootstrap app (in BASIC!) to take advantage of the Mac’s serial port and enable the user to download a more serious terminal app. Later I published the first Macintosh BBS Mouse Exchange BBS, and the first graphical interface to a BBS.</p>
<h2>Open Standards (1985)</h2>
<p>Later in 1985 I experienced my next tool for ignition — though “tool” may seem an odd term to describe something so abstract — open standards. I had recently parlayed my facilitation skills into a paid position as a CompuServe sysop, and because of my bootstrap app, the Mac BBS that I published, I participated in my first open standard, called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBinary>MacBinary</a>, a way of encoding early Mac applications so that they could be transferred online.</p>
<p>This was my first experience working with other engineers to facilitate the creation of something quite ephemeral and hard to describe to non-programmers. Not quite software, but a language between software, enabling them to share information and work together despite being written by different people in different programming languages.</p>
<p>In the open standards community I learned the value of some principles that I use daily: "Ship early and often", "Fail fast", "Perfection is the enemy of the good", "Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept", etc.</p>
<p>My experience with MacBinary motivated me to continue participating in open standards efforts over the years, leading to what I consider my biggest success as a facilitator and co-author of the <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt>SSL Standard</a>, the world's most widely deployed security standard. What drew me to SSL (as opposed to competitive security standards offered by others) was that it could be used for much more than just internet transactions. It could be used to secure a variety of conversations between people. Using the power of the RFC editor, I <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers>reserved ports</a> for secure SMTP, IMAP, POP, IRC, FTP and more. I got some flack for this as internet ports are considered a limited resource, but it turned out well when SSL and these ports were used twenty years later during the Arab Spring to help ensure freedom of communication between protesters.</p>
<h2>HyperCard (1987)</h2>
<p>Twenty-five years ago this month — August 11,1987 at MacWorld — I encountered <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson>Bill Atkinson's</a> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard>Hypercard</a>. Hard to describe but truly a tool for ignition if there ever was one, Hypercard has been variously called a "stack of virtual cards, "hypermedia system", "programming for the masses". Bill Atkinson described it as "a construction kit that lets normal people make their own software".</p>
<p>I was already programming in a variety of programming languages, but like MacPaint before it, HyperCard drew me in because of its elegance and its ability to allow non-programmers to participate in the creation of software. You can see the most complex HyperCard stack I ever wrote, running a TV studio at Apple Computer, in the first 40 seconds of this <a href=http://archive.org/details/hypercard_2>1990 video feature</a> on HyperCard.</p>
<p>HyperCard empowered a whole generation of passionate, creative people who otherwise never would have had the chance to share their ideas and visions with the world. I saw thinkers I admired begin to express their thoughts through software. Artists and designers loved that they could bring their language of imagery to life. Children who never had programmed before would start by drawing on some "cards", add buttons, show their friends, get excited and ultimately start on the path to learn how to express oneself through software. Amazing stories were told: some of my favorites were "If Monks Had Macs", "Spaceship Warlock", "Beyond Cyperpunk" and ultimately <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst>Myst</a>.</p>
<p><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6llXEJWlkTXTnx1w9A4-QrDaHAtLqsFlGBUSo1ZyzEcLcUgSQGTvDRzbPkywmya5xmwfLzYhSumo9ZJOChJObJD-piKzx8byUQbkTmjw4P29ixJ17Q4 alt="" height=417px; width=576px;></p>
<p>HyperCard had a profound impact beyond those who discovered and used it on the Mac. Many do not know that <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee>Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the creator of the World Wide Web, was <a href=http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html>inspired</a> by HyperCard. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham>Ward Cunningham</a>, investor of the first Wiki also <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiHyperCard>credits</a> it for inspiration.</p>
<h2>HyperCard's 25th Anniversary</h2>
<p>In celebration of Hypercard's 25th anniversary, we asked Bill Atkinson to come to the Hillside Club in Berkeley to <a href=http://sites.google.com/a/hillsideclub.org/hillsideclub/programs/cybersalons>speak</a>. In advance of this, I asked my colleagues and friends to share what inspired them about HyperCard by posting to blogs and twitter using the hashtag <a href=https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23hypercard25th>#HyperCard25th</a>. Here are some of my favorite appreciations:</p>

<h2>Infinite Canvas (2012)</h2>
<p>It is the mindset expressed in three more quotes from <a href=https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23hypercard25th>#HyperCard25th</a> neatly sum up what inspired me to create a new tool for ignition — <a href=http://www.infinitecanvasapp.com/>Infinite Canvas</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since 2007 I have been running a participatory event, originally called iPhoneDevCamp, but now called <a href=http://www.iosdevcamp.org/>iOSDevCamp</a>. Over the course of a weekend we get ~400-500 people to stay up late and show their effort in a Hackathon. At the <a href=http://www.iosdevcamp.org/2012/07/23/ios-devcamp-2012-awards/>last one</a> 71 new iPhone and iPad apps were created in 36 hours, 29 of which were <a href=http://www.iosdevcamp.org/2012/07/26/open-source-apps-at-iosdevcamp-2012/>open source</a>.</p>
<p>iOSDevCamp appeals to me because it is creative ignition in action — it was founded on twitter, organized as an online community, supports the ideals of collaboration and nutures passionate creative people. In recent years I've been quite proud of the diversity of the conference, with <a href=http://www.xeodesign.com/tiltstory.html>designers</a>, <a href=http://ipadportraits.blogspot.com/2012/07/ipad-portrait-of-paul-ossenbruggen.html>artists</a>, <a href=http://ebayinkblog.com/2012/08/08/girls-ideas-take-center-stage-at-iosdevcamp/>women</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYooh4UU_H0&amp;feature=plcp">young adults</a> and even <a href=http://www.iosdevcamp.org/2012/08/04/qa-with-krithika-yetchina-winner-of-best-woman-entrepreneur/>children</a> participating.</p>
<p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L3ESdmV0HCk-468UAzVPlU_rVBCl5trMN1TARxQNrmyhMf5hB-YkzxvPCpLr08BEUt9oYdBXclqFP5yjh9WfQHOforcIM2PTkQC3fA7J1E7pFN51oEU alt="" height=266px; width=400px;></p>
<p>However, today the barriers between being a spectator and becoming a creator are huge. It is increasingly hard for a new user to create a good-looking web page. The skills required to create an iPhone or iPad app are quite intimidating. I have had many designers show up at iOSDevCamp whom I was unable to match with a coder because they lacked the most basic understanding of the principles of interactivity. Sadly, I was unable to facilitate their full participation.</p>
<p>So at iOSDevCamp 2010 I started <a href=http://www.infinitecanvasapp.com/>Infinite Canvas</a>, based on the principles of what inspired me about HyperCard. This tool needed to allow artists, designers, photographers, children to easily experience creating interactive stories and experiences. It needed to not only be easy to use, but also easy to share — no gatekeepers saying "This isn't good enough". It needed to support discoverability, where those new to the language of interactivity could learn and advance their skills to ultimately create quite sophisticated experiences. And it needed to take advantage of the new computing experiences that the iPad offers — portability, touchability — advantages that even the lightest laptop was never quite able to match.<img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-R0dPu8LFfhE45XG327JNH1ZlNRqH_Z3kRftvNsLCIRIPUM3HMyboMtNiBSqyrd_qvtOiDq6DTQnZKricdwNvzjN9Labtk7iIF8fSIbVGl4KT_HQFwI align=right height=160px; width=120px; alt=""></p>
<p>The first version of <a href=http://bit.ly/infinitecanvasapp>Infinite Canvas</a> iPad app, initially a viewer-only version, was approved and <a href=http://www.infinitecanvasapp.com/2012/08/11/announcing-the-release-of-infinite-canvas-viewer-in-the-app-store/>released</a> Friday in the Apple App Store, the day before HyperCard's anniversary. There is a library of example canvases available which can be downloaded for free using the app. Users will be able to create their own canvases in the near future when the Infinite Canvas authoring tool makes its debut.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go to offer all that HyperCard offered. We support both simple tiles and HTML5 tiles, but the learning bridge between them is huge. But in the spirit of "Ship early and often", "fail fast", and "perfection is the enemy of the good" we wanted to make this tool available now.</p>
<p>Bill Atkinson once <a href=http://archive.org/details/hypercard_2>explained what motivated him to create HyperCard:</a> "A lot of people are going to get opened up, enabled, empowered to control their computer. That's really what we're trying to do.” And that is exactly what we are trying to do on the iPad with Infinite Canvas.</p>

				<p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563798/ title="Trust Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3055563798_5355b9b99c_m.jpg alt="Trust Circle" height=160 width=240 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>With Google+ almost two weeks into its test phase, conversation about this new social network service seems to be going in circles.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>That’s because Circles is the Google+ feature that users are generating the most buzz about. It’s Google’s answer to the problem of organizing your social graph online.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph>social graph</a> it’s a map of everyone you know and how they are related to you. Social graphs are tricky; as you try to define them you’ll inevitably run into some complications.</p>
<p>Pete Pachal, news director of <a href=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2387808,00.asp>@PCMag</a> comments:</p>
<blockquote><em>“People want things easy, and Google Circles isn’t easy. It puts the burden on users to take the time to think about each and every contact and put them in a specific bucket. To use the feature effectively, users will certainly have to create new Circles, and that requires even more thought. After using Google+ for a few minutes last night, I was often unsure which Circles to put certain people in and, more to the point, which to leave them out of. And what if you create a new Circle that should include some of the people in other Circles you already have?”</em></blockquote>
<p>Circles are lists that you’ve created by grouping people together and giving them a name. They’re important in Google+ because when you post you must explicitly say which “Circles” you wish to share with. Posting to a limited list of people is a big change from existing social networks such as Facebook, where posts are sent to all mutual friends by default, or Twitter, where posts are public. This change forces you to think more deeply about your social graph and who should see each item you post.</p>
<p><iframe src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/BwvygI2xKGM height=349 width=560 frameborder=0></iframe></p>
<h2 id=yourinitialsetofcircles>Your Initial Set of Circles</h2>
<p>Google+ will present you with 4 suggested set of Circles: Friends, Family, Acquaintances, and Following.</p>
<p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d-pi style="display: inline;"><img border=0 src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d-800wi alt=Default-google+-circles title=Default-google+-circles class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d image-full"></a> <br>Google+ also defines five special Circles: Two are only for reading: "Stream" which is everyone in any of your Circles; and "Incoming" which is are posts that are shared to you by people not in your Circles. Then are three special Circles managed by Google only for posting: "Your Circles" which is everyone in any of your Circles; “Extended” which is everyone in your Circles plus the people in <em>their</em> Circles; and “Public” which is <em>anyone</em>.</p>
<p>Few find this default set to be sufficient. As a result, most Google+ users are soon creating new Circles, moving people around, renaming Circles, etc.</p>
<p>There are sound reasons for people finding the default Circles limiting. Sociological research shows that everyone has a number of concentric personal circles (see my blog post <a href=../../2008/11/personal-circle.html>Community by the Numbers, Part II: Personal Circles</a> for more details). These circles are sometimes called “ego-centric” social graphs as the individual is located in the center. This sort of graph is the model I used when I began reorganizing my own Google+ Circles.</p>
<p>I started out using Support (for my Support Circle), Close (for my Sympathy Circle), Trusted (for my Trust Circle), and Colleagues (for my Emotional Circle), but that didn’t work for very long. I’ve since been experimenting with a number of different ways to organize my Circles. I wanted an initial set that would offer useful early advice for using Google+ but would still be applicable for when expanded to hundreds of people. (I now have over 600 people in my Circles.)</p>
<p>One insight I’ve had is to avoid the word ‘friends’, which has been corrupted to almost meaninglessness in recent years. So instead I use terminology like Peers for my trust circle and Kith for the combination of my support and sympathy circles. (Kith may be familiar to you from the phrase “kith and kin”. The root of kith means “to know”, thus it’s those people that you know very well and that know you very well.)</p>
<p>I also learned that sub-Circles exist within Circles. Using a ‘general ledger’ system of naming Circles with numbers—which I’ll demonstrate in a moment—helps me keep these Circles and sub-Circles in order and allows me to easily add new Circles when I need to. Hopefully Google+ will in the future introduce features that allow us to order Circles as we please, but until then this numbering system works.</p>
<p>Working with Google+ has also shown me that some Circles are for reading and other Circles are for posting. I’ll talk a little more about this below.</p>
<p>It has only been a week, but by combining these insights to organize my Circles I’ve improved my ease of use and become better able to manage my time while using Google+.</p>
<p>Here is my recommended initial list of Circles:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>0.0 ME</strong> - a simple Circle with just yourself in it, for saving posts, for drafts, etc.<br><strong>1.0 KIN</strong> - your family &amp; extended family<br> <strong> 2.0 KITH</strong> - your best friends, your confidants (i.e. those with whom one shares a secret or private matter, trusting them not to repeat it to others)<br><strong> 3.0 PEERS</strong> - your trusted colleagues, those who you work closely with, your collaborators<br><strong> 4.0 LOCAL</strong> - your neighbors, parents of your children's friends, people you'd invite to a party<br><strong> 5.0</strong> {various groups &amp; interests}<br><strong> 6.0 ACQUAINTANCES</strong> - people you know, but that you don't know well or that don’t know you well<br><strong> 7.0 FOLLOWS ME</strong> - people who follow you on Google+, who you may or may not know<br><strong> 8.0 WATCHING</strong> - people whose posts you read, but who don't necessarily read your posts<br><strong> 9.0 SPECIAL</strong> - useful for special lists &amp; exceptions</p>
<h2 id=expandingcircles>Expanding Circles</h2>
<p>Many people will find my default set of ~10 Circles to be very useful, and need only add a few more. However, the design of this set is to allow for much greater expansion should you need it.</p>
<p>Like those “personal circles” that I wrote about previously, most of the Circles above are ego-centric: they’re fundamentally centered on your own personal social graph. This isn’t the only potential type of Circle, however. Socio-centric Circles aren’t centered on you, though they still have some sort of membership boundaries, while info-centric Circles are based on topics instead of being based on relationships. These socio-centric and info-centric Circles will support many relationships better than ego-centric Circles do.</p>
<p>If someone seems to write a lot about a particular topic, I put him or her into an appropriate info-centric Circle. My own info-centric Circles thus include people who post about topics like iOS Development, the Social Web, Sustainability/Green, and Entrepreneuring. If a number of people are all part of a group or all come from a certain geographical area then I put them together in a socio-centric circle. After creating the Circles, I put the ones that were geographic into 4.0 of my ledger, then placed the others in 5.0. (I tried separating out groups and interests, and found that didn’t work, so now I keep them together.)</p>
<p>I now have over 600 people in my Google Plus+ social graph. All together my Circles now look something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>0.0 Read Later<br> 0.1 Drafts<br> 0.2 Book Project<br> 0.3 iPad Project<br><br> 1.0 ALL KIN<br> 1.1 Immediate Family<br> 1.2 Extended Family<br><br> 2.0 ALL KITH<br> 2.1 Close Friends<br> 2.2 Old But Distant Friends<br> 2.3 Distant Family<br><br> 3.0 ALL PEERS<br> 3.2 Collaborators<br> 3.3 Current Professional Colleagues<br> 3.4 Former Professional Colleagues<br><br> 4.0 ALL LOCAL<br> 4.1 Local Kith, Kin &amp; Peers<br> 4.2 Local Berkeley<br> 4.3 Non-Local Seattle<br> 4.3 Non-Local Portland<br><br> 5.0 ALL GROUPS &amp; INTERESTS<br> 5.1 Entrepreneurs<br> 5.2 Apple &amp; iOS<br> 5.3 - iOSDevCamp<br> 5.4 Green &amp; Sustainability<br> 5.5 - BGIedu<br> 5.6 Social Web<br> 5.7 - Jerry’s Kids<br><br> 6.0 ACQUAINTANCES<br> 6.1 Familiar Strangers<br> 6.2 Friendly Strangers<br><br> 7.0 FOLLOWS ME<br> 7.1 Core Audience<br> 7.2 Commented or Shared My Posts<br><br> 8.0 WATCHING<br> 8.2 Pundits<br> 8.3 Celebrities<br> 8.4 Noisy<br><br> 9.0 ALL<br> 9.1 Everyone But Pundits, Celebrities &amp; Noisy<br> 9.2 Read Daily<br> 9.3 Read Weekly</strong></p>
<p>In a future blog post I’ll share my ongoing experience with using this approach to Circles, but this example shows how easy it is to separate and add Circles as your interests change and grow.</p>
<h1 id=managingyourcircles>Managing Your Circles</h1>
<p>We, as humans, enjoy social networks in large part because we get to interact with people. Managing your Circles is thus about more than just understanding your social graph. It also allows you to manage your time effectively when you read and share with other people on Google+. Here is my approach for how to manage the time you spend reading, sharing, and managing your social graph.</p>
<h3 id=circlesforreading><strong>Circles for Reading</strong></h3>
<p>I find it useful to think about Circles that are explicitly for reading as different from Circles intended for sharing. I have a few of these read-only Circles. Thus, my “Pundits” Circle contains people that share a lot and for whom I don’t always want to read everything. My “Read Daily” Circle is conversely for people for whom I want to read everything they post.</p>
<p>I’ve also found Circles helpful for close collaborators. It’s easy in Google+ to have a conversation with someone directly by simply typing their name as +&lt;name&gt; into the share field of posts. However, I find these direct posts get lost over time. To resolve this problem, create a Circle dedicated to just the two of you: a dyad. I have a number of people that I’m collaborating with closely and I use these small Circles to both keep track of our mutual posts and to see what they are thinking about at the moment. Examples of this kind of two-person Circle include my “Book Project” and “iPad Project”</p>
<h3 id=timemanagementofreadingcircles><strong>Time Management of Reading Circles</strong></h3>
<p>Each day I look first at my “ALL KIN”, “ALL KITH” and and “ALL PEER” Circles to see what is going on with my support, sympathy and trust cliques. Then I’ll read my “Read Daily” Circles.</p>
<p>After reading these daily basics (which I try to keep to a limited number), I’ll typically pick an interest, a geography, or a group, depending on what I’m doing that day. (My personal time-management style is to only follow one interest per day, e.g. if I am working on my iPad app then I’m not reading Social Web posts.) If I’m preparing a blog post and want to see what my audience is thinking I might review “Core Audience”, or “FOLLOWS ME”. If I’m traveling I might read one of my non-local Circles such as “Seattle”. If I’m doing ‘weak-signal research’ I might start with “ALL INTERESTS”, but if I’m particularly tolerant of noise I might read “Familiar Strangers”, “FOLLOWS ME”, “Everyone but Pundits &amp; Strangers”, “Pundits”, or even “ALL”.</p>
<h2 id=postingtocircles>Posting to Circles</h2>
<p>One of the important reasons for creating Circles in the first place is so that you can share with groups of people. I’ve developed some strategies for this as well.</p>
<h3 id=circlesforposting:><strong>Circles for Posting</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve found it useful to create a Circle that only contains yourself. I have two of these — “Read Later”, and “Drafts”. If I’m reading and I see something interesting but don’t have time for it immediately, I’ll share it with my “Read Later” Circle so that I can quickly go back to it. Similarly, if I need to do some more research before writing and sharing, I’ll share my immediate thoughts in “Drafts”. As new features are added to Google+ these Circles will hopefully become obsolete, but they are useful for now.</p>
<h3 id=managingsharingprivacyofprivateposts><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Private Posts</strong></h3>
<p>When sharing, you want to ask yourself if this is ‘private’ post, a ‘quasi-public’ post or a ‘public’ post.</p>
<p>My private posts tend to go “KIN”, “KITH”, a dyad project, or one of the sub-Circles of PEER depending on their context. Some posts that are of only geographic interest (say a party, or local event) will be shared privately to the appropriate local Circle. If you are using my ledger system of using numbers in Circle names, these are the lower numbers—5.0 and below are Circles where I’m more sensitive about privacy.</p>
<p>Once shared, these more personal posts will be labeled as “Limited” instead of using the “Public” label that allows anyone to see them. If a recipient tries to share a “Limited” post, a box will pop up reminding the person: “This post was originally shared with a limited audience – remember to be thoughtful about who you share it with”. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, one purpose of Circles on Google+ is to determine who gets what information.</p>
<p>Though it may be easy to create Circles to segregate those with whom you wish to share private information, the recipients of your posts have no such limitations and could share outward beyond your intent (though they will be warned if they try to, as noted above). To enable further privacy you can disable resharing of these personal posts made to your Circles. To do so, share your post to a non-public Circle, then you select the arrow in the upper-right-hand corner where you can edit, delete or disable the post, and click on the final option, “Disable Reshare”.</p>
<p>There’s another privacy issue: by clicking the grey “Limited” label, a message’s recipient can see all others you shared the post with. This could potentially result in privacy problems, as the reader could discover who is in one of your Circles. There are ways of eliminating this by going into your Privacy account settings, which I will cover in a future post.</p>
<h3 id=managingsharingprivacyofquasi-publicposts><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Quasi-Public Posts</strong></h3>
<p>I call posts “quasi-public” when they’re of narrow interest to a specific group or a topic that isn’t really relevant to other members of my audience. I find these quasi-public posts happen the most for my more esoteric interests—for instance, when I’m sharing a complex iPhone development article that is really only interesting to a narrow group of my contacts.</p>
<p>In Google Reader, I typically wouldn’t share these articles at all because there were so many of my contacts that wouldn’t be interested in them and it would only be noise to them. Ditto with Twitter. I found that sometimes people would stop following me after a conference I attended because I posted regularly and the conference was not of interest to them. This could be quite frustrating at times. Though these posts were not private by any means, I only wanted to share them with a specific group, such as an iPhone group. Now with Circles, I can share this information easily with my “Apple &amp; iOS” Circle. I find that this feature is what makes Google+’s Circles so potentially powerful.</p>
<p>Though I might offer much of this more esoteric information as “quasi-public” posts to a specific group or interest, I’ll probably offer the best of them to the “Public”. Sometimes that is what it means to be a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven>Maven</a>—you share across social network boundaries.</p>
<h3 id=managingsharingprivacyofpublicposts><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Public Posts</strong></h3>
<p>Sharing a post to your “Your Circles” is effectively public, as is sharing to “Extended Circles”. Ask yourself if there is really some reason why you don’t want to make a post totally “Public” so that it is searchable by those who are not members of Google+. If there is some reason, consider sharing to your “ALL” Circle or some other more limited circle instead, as you’ll have more control and can turn off resharing or commenting.</p>
<h2 id=managingyoursocialgraph>Managing Your Social Graph</h2>
<p>Maintaining your Circles can take away from the time you can spend on reading and sharing. I’ve come up with the following strategy to limit the time I spend.</p>
<p>To start with, I have some basic rules for which Circles to place people in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I’m notified that someone is following me, I add them to “FOLLOWS ME” and an appropriate other Circle. If I vaguely recognize a follower’s name or face, I put them in “Familiar Strangers”. If I don’t recognize them at all but they look interesting, I add them to “Friendly Strangers”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I’m notified that someone has +1’ed, commented, or mentioned me in a post, I add them to “Core Audience” and the appropriate sub-Circle. I will also make sure that the other Circles they are in are correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I discover while I’m reading that someone is too noisy for the Circle I selected, I’ll move them to a more appropriate Circle—or place them in the “Noisy” Circle or even block them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=timemanagementofyoursocialgraph><strong>Time Management of Your Social Graph</strong></h3>
<p>In addition I review a few of my Circles every day. I do so by going to “Manage Circles”, then selecting “People in your Circles” and sorting by last name. I choose that letter of the alphabet that corresponds to the day of the month and hover my mouse over each name. (For example, I look at names starting with “L” on July 12th, as “L” is the 12th letter.) Google+ highlights the Circles that each person is in. If they’re in the wrong Circle, I move them. I might even click on some people and review their profile so that I can see who they are—or (if I already know them) see what they are up to lately, update my address book, and maybe send them a brief email. At the end of the month (on the 27th through the 31st) I review my overall Circles lists. This way, over the course of each month I briefly review my entire social network, without spending too much time on it. (I try to spend 10 minutes or so a day.)</p>
<p>Periodically (right now weekly, but hopefully eventually monthly) I do some larger scale management of my Circles. Learning how to do this the first time is a pain, but once you know how it only takes a few minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I go to “Manage Circles” and select “People Who Have Added You”. I sort that list by “Not Yet in Circles”, “Select All” and add the people revealed to “FOLLOWS ME”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I then do the same with all of my Circles to update my “ALL” Circle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I copy my “ALL” circle to “Everyone But Pundits, Celebrities &amp; Noisy” and remove any Pundits, Celebrities or Noisy people from that Circle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When managing your Circles, remember the motto “Perfection is the Enemy of the Good”. You are the only one that sees who is in which Circle, and you can place people in multiple Circles. So your Circles don’t have to be perfect, just good enough. If you share a lot of private posts, concentrate on making sure that those more personal Circles are more accurate.</p>
<p>Using these approaches, you should find Circle management quick, and you won’t get mired down in Circle management for hours at a time.</p>
<h1 id=summary>Summary</h1>
<p>Looking back, I wish I had this organization when I started on Google+ two weeks ago. By using some of these techniques from the beginning I would have made my life a lot easier. Over the next month I now have to go back and re-organize people and re-Circle them. I hope sharing these tips will make your use of Google+ simpler from the start!</p>
<p>Also, I expect that Google will be adding new features to make Google+ easier. For instance I’m hoping for #hashtags (the ability to tag posts into topic categories), favorites (the ability to tag posts into a persistent archive, hopefully with an option tag), ordering Circles, concentric Circles, and better integration with Google Reader. (I share my favorite blog posts on <a href=http://www.google.com/reader/shared/ChristopherA target=_self>Google Reader</a> at  and my best of best articles and posts in <a href=http://twitter.com/ChristopherA/favorites target=_self>Twitter Favorites</a> or <a href=http://delicious.com/christophera target=_self>Delicious</a>.)</p>
<p>As with any new online feature, people are finding out new things and coming up with new ideas every day. So what are <em>your</em> methods for organizing your Circles and social graph?</p>

				<p>One of the common practices in the independent movie industry is to share favors to keep production costs low. I loan you use of a camera and you later do some editing for me on the cheap. Of course, it is often actually less direct then that: I loan you the camera, the community knows that I am generous, and when I need some editing time on the cheap, my social capital in the film community makes the resource available to me.</p>

<p>The real value of participating in this exchange is in the reciprocity and the social capital, but if the indie project is financially successful some ill will can arise about who really owes whom. One way that some creative producers deal with this is to have in effect two budgets, the real budget, and the virtual budget. Joss Whedon (creator and producer of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, <em>Serenity</em>, <em>Firefly</em>, <em>Dollhouse</em>, etc.) describes how he did this for his recent successful internet project <a href=http://www.drhorrible.com/><em>Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</em></a> in a recent <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2152">interview</a> at the Wharton business school:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdlasica/2858261316/ style=" float: right;"><img border=0 src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2858261316_40a63f6dd5_m.jpg alt="Joss Whedon photo" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>Whedon:</strong> We got so much of this done through people doing us favors — department heads and people who have access to things. But you've got to pay your day-to-day crew. The actors all did it for nothing. And we all did it for nothing. So, the production costs alone — the basic costs of filming the thing, and getting the locations, props and everything — ran a little over $200,000.</em></p>

<p><em>We had a secondary budget drawn up in case of a profit, wherein we were trying to find rates for Internet materials. In some cases they didn't exist. We used models that had been created by the guild for repurposed, or reused, material that we used for original [content], because this had never come up before.</em></p>

<p><em>We didn't want to leave a sour taste and say, "Well, we made some money off of you guys being kind." It was like: No, everybody has to benefit from what they've done, obviously not enormously — it's Internet money we're talking about — but as soon as we got in the black, we paid everybody off.</em></p>

<p><em>So that budget was probably about twice what the original budget was.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You've now earned more than twice the original cost?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> Yes.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Which members of the production shared in the profits on the backend?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> The crew that got paid, got paid. [Those] who didn't get paid [included people like] department heads who had jobs and could afford to do this as a lark.</em></p>

<p><em>As we go forward into profit, there are also residual schedules and payment schedules for all of the creative people. We're trying to figure out how that works.</em></p>

<p><em>From the start I also laid down a gross participation scheme for my three key actors and the other three writers. While the guild was negotiating for one-tenth of a yen, I said, "How about we just get into some percentages." It was an opportunity to say to the guilds, "Guess how much better we can do" — which, in the case of the Internet, is the only way for the guilds to survive.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've used a similar technique for internet startups, where the favors and the free time often fly wild and cause the entrepreneurs problems later.</p>

<p>My general rule of thumb is to get entrepreneurs to think one-third brains, one-third brawn, and one-third money. That is, people who bring knowledge, people, resources, brand, etc. get 1/3 of the outcome, people who actually work on the project get 1/3, and people who fronted the money or paid cash for expenses get the last third. Many people get a little equity from all three piles. If money comes in, the people who fronted cash get their money back first, then the other shares of revenues are distributed to everyone else based on the contributions.</p>

<p>It isn't a perfect model, but an afternoon of discussion with a team early on the entrepreneurial process--using this as a starting point for discussions — is often very successful in addressing future issues head-on before people become invested in differing expectations.</p>

<p>I suspect that many other industries may have interesting creative ideas on how to monetize favor if an outcome is good, but otherwise give out reciprocity of favors or social capital in the common good. Do you know of any of these?</p>

				<a href=http://www.blogactionday.org style=" float: right;"><img border=0 src=http://www.blogactionday.org/imgs/badges/bad-180-150.jpg alt="" class="selected "></a>
<p>Late this evening while catching up on my feeds, I saw for the first time that this year's <a href=http://site.blogactionday.org/>Blog Action Day</a> is on the topic of <a href=http://site.blogactionday.org/general/8-great-climate-change-resources-for-your-blog-action-day-post/>Climate Change</a>. This event is sponsored yearly by <a href=http://www.change.org/>Change.org</a>. I wish I had known earlier as this would have been a great exercise for my sustainable MBA students at BGI.edu, as they are all creating their blogs this week for my <a href=../../2009/09/teaching-using-the-social-web-for-social-change-at-bgiedu.html>class</a> "Using the Social Web for Social Change".</p>

<p>This is now the second time this week that a significant event on this topic has slipped by me. Apparently on Monday the 19th there will be a <a href=http://www.socialmediacsr.com/>Social Media for Sustainability Conference</a> in San Francisco, that seems to have a really good <a href=http://www.socialmediacsr.com/speakers.html>list of speakers</a>. But I only heard about it yesterday.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that as a blogger I'm not hooked in tight with the sustainability community — clearly because of my BGIedu connections I am sympathetic, but I mainly for the last I've have been writing about the social web or the iPhone. My disconnect demonstrates the challenge of communicating outside your own social circles, both for those trying to create change, and to those that might benefit from the message.</p>

<p>Which brings me to a point that I need to make to my students – we have to figure out how to get ourselves out of info ruts. I teach a technique of Scan Focus Act that is really good at letting you manage your time to read and connect to a larger number of people via blogs, however, if you are too insular, you still may not get the information you need on time. It is through the weak links that we often get our useful information from, and we have to take time to maintain those weak links as well as the strong links to our community that are more easy to maintain as they are more satisfying.</p>

<p>Other then the fact that I learned about it late, I'm reasonably pleased by the example that the Blog Action Day website serves for my students. It satisfies the basic principles of identification and connection, and has a number of good <a href=http://www.blogactionday.org/en/takeaction>calls for action</a>, the first being to register your blog. The links featuring blog posts with <a href=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/A-Green-Blog-Action-Day/ style="color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important; ">whitehouse.gov</a>, UK prime minister <a href=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20931 style="color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important; ">Gordon Brown</a>, and a number of major websites, including the third on the list being in spanish, give the site a credibility. The most recents tab gave the site authenticity. I think I probably would have made the signup process shorter, and had users fill out information later, but it wasn't bad. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things at this website which will be a good jumping off point for my students to think about as they work on their on blogs on sustainability, and their future Social Change media projects.</p>

				<p><a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/bank_book.htm style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c-320wi alt="Power of Conversation" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c "></a> I was musing as I was preparing for next week's Intensive at <a href=../../2009/09/teaching-using-the-social-web-for-social-change-at-bgiedu.html>BGI</a> that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That's because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.</p>

<p>I talk about this a bit in my <a href=../../2008/09/group-threshold.html>Group Threshold</a> and <a href=../../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>Dunbar Number</a> posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the <a href=../../2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number>“Judas Number”</a> nadir, or low point. These group threshold nadirs exist when groups are too large for some processes to function effectively, but too small for others to work.</p>

<p>I am particularly aware of this threshold when I host small parties at my home. At 7 or so people everything just seems to work — conversations flow, everybody gets to participate, and everyone has fun. A the numbers climb past 10 I find that I as the host have to work harder, to be more aware of making sure that everyone is having a good time and that no one is left out. At some point as a party gets larger things just begin to flow again, as there are enough people that small groups can form and conversation flows well once more.</p>

<p>I've also seen this at business meetings. When my entrepreneurial companies were small an “all hands” meeting could be incredibly effective. All the issues and ideas got brought up, and everyone felt committed to our decisions. However, as these meeting grew, at some point the “all hands” meeting took too long and started requiring process and rules to be effective. The energy this consumed also diminished much of the efficacy of the meeting.</p>

It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which <a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/>The World Café</a> and <a href=""></a><a href=http://www.conversationcafe.org/>Conversation Café</a> are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called <a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/articles/cafetogo.pdf>Cafe To Go</a>.</p>

<p>The Braid is a little more organized then the more ad-hoc Café Method. When you start a meeting you are given a small card that tells you which table to sit at for each round. Each table is assigned a scribe for each round to take notes at the table, and to report out the notes to everyone who arrives for the next round.</p>

<p>One nice thing about the organization of The Braid is that over the course of a number of rounds you'll have a brand new group of people to talk to during each round. Thus over the course of an hour or so you'll actually get to have a relatively short yet rich conversation with almost everyone in the room, rather than with just a few.</p>

<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Four Table Braid"><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/3960601974_652a29b96f.jpg alt="Four Table Braid" height=453 width=433></a> There are different forms of The Braid for different numbers of tables and sizes of groups, but my favorite is the Four Table Braid for groups of a minimum of 16 to a maximum of 28 people. One of the peculiar things about this Braid is that it seems to function well if people arrive at different times. The Braid fills first table A with 4 people so that they can begin talking, then fills table B, C, and D the same way. Once those tables are full, new arrivals are woven into The Braid one at a time until all tables have 5 people, then 6, then the max of 7 for a total of 28 people.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about the Four Table Braid is that no one needs to be the scribe more then once; the task is equally shared among all but the last 8 to arrive in a group of 28. Also, in just 4 rounds with 16 people, 90%+ of the participants have met. With 28 people, you simply only need 5 rounds to match the same 90%+ meeting percentage.</p>

<p>I find The Braid useful for a variety of different situations. The simplest usage is as a group warming and introduction exercise. You need not do more then two or three rounds in order for more than half of the people to have met each other. The Braid is also useful with a focused objective. For instance, I once used it after a game designers' conference, with each table having a list of "game design laws" where the participants were asked to either give an example that was in favor of the law or contradicted the law. It also can be useful in combination with a variety of other group process techniques, for instance after an MG Taylor Take-A-Panel, where each participant first creates a page telling a story about themselves 15 years in the future and then the group uses The Braid to discover common insights. The Braid can also be good before an Open Space or other unconference event.</p>

<p>I am including here my templates for a <a href=../../files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf>Four Table Braid</a>. It includes 28 cards for printing on Avery business card paper, 4 table pages with instructions for participants, and 1 page with instructions for the host. I make these available as <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/ rel=license>CC-BY-NC-SA</a> license. I welcome any DTP folks out there who would like to make these documents more functional or more attractive.</p>

<p>A Three Table Braid is easy to figure out by hand, but larger Braids are more difficult. I've never figured out an algorithm for designing these quickly (any math wizzes out there?) so I've posted my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0">spreadsheet</a> for the Four Table Braid for those of you who might wish to figure out how to implement larger numbers of tables. I would love to have a Ten Table Braid as a warm up exercise for a small unconference.</p>

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/13957977@N02/2460905893/ style="float: right;" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank','scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2136/2460905893_0c3fc213c5_m.jpg alt="Key in Door" title="Key in Door" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 1px; "></a>Passwords are very important for maintaining your online identity, because they ensure that no one else can access your accounts and do things that you wouldn't do. As such, you should make sure that your online passwords are as strong as possible. This article will provide some general guidelines for doing so.</p>

<h3>Multiple Passwords</h3>

<p>Note that I said that you want to ensure your passwords, plural, are strong. That's because you'll want at least two. They should both be good passwords, but they should be used in different places.</p>

<p>Use a “non-secure” password for any non-financial websites that you sign up for, such as Facebook and Twitter. Use a different “secure” password for places where your credit card is on file or money changes hands, such as eBay, Amazon, your bank, and your stock broker. Because banks and other financial institutions are more likely to maintain good security over their transactions, reserving a password only for those sites makes it more likely that they will remain safe.</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be the tip of the iceberg. You might want to create a third password for shopping sites, or another one for less reliable sites that you might use. Ideally you would use a different password for every site. That would surely be the most secure, as someone breaking into one site couldn't get into your other accounts — but clearly that is too many passwords to remember. As a compromise, I'll talk shortly about an easy technique to both remember and vary your passwords.</p>

<h3>Criteria for Bad Passwords</h3>

<p>In a moment, I'm going to suggest an excellent method for creating a secure password. However, if you prefer to use your own methods, be sure to watch out for these common problems which could result weak passwords.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use obvious words. There was a time when “password” was one of the most common passwords on the internet (along with “root” and “”).
</li>
<li>Do not use words from the dictionary as passwords. Some of the oldest password crackers just dumped the entire dictionary at an account to see if any of them worked as passwords. This doesn't apply just to English either. It's easy enough for a password cracker to use any dictionary, whether it be French or Klingon.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on a dictionary word with simple substitutions. Though I'll talk in a bit about the advantage of substituting letters for numbers, a dictionary word with simple substitutions will be no more secure than just a dictionary word. That's because later password crackers would run not only the dictionary, but also a dictionary with a few substitutions, such as “0”s for “o”s and “1”s for “l”s.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on multiple dictionary words concatenated together. If you were concatenating three or four words, you might be OK, but password crackers were checking two word dictionary concatenations a decade ago.
</li>
<li>Do not use obvious names of people or places you know. Your girlfriend's name, your street address, and your favorite pet's name are all straight out. A password cracker may not be able to guess these (though testing against common names is another strategy used by some), but if someone who knows you can break in by hand, that's no good either.
</li>
<li>Do not write down your password, and especially do not write down your password in an online or computer file. If you picked the best password in the world, it doesn't matter if someone else can easily look at it.
</li>
<li>Do not keep the same password forever. It's pain, but you really should change it every year or two, at least, just in case someone has broken into one of your accounts, and you don't know it.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>A Method for Creating a Strong Password</h3>

<p>So you've learned a lot about what makes a bad password. What makes a good password? The following suggests one method that you can use to create a password that's not easily breakable — but which is easily memorable.
</p>

<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3952128651/ style="float: right;" title="Safari by ChristopherA, on Flickr" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank','scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img height=500 src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3952128651_b6842a0ecf.jpg alt="Password Meter" title="Password Meter" width=363></a>

<ol>
<li>Pick a short phrase, or an obscure but memorable long word. For example “amber waves” or “perspicacious”.
</li>
<li>Shorten it to 7 characters, such as “ambrwvs” or “prspccus”.
</li>
<li>Convert a letter other then first to a number. You can use those obvious substitutions here (e.g., A=4, B=8, E=3, G=6, I=1, L=1, O=0, R=2, S=5, T=7), since they're not your only method of security. This might produce “ambrwv5” or “pr5pccus”.
</li>
<li>The next part is the key trick: use a specific letter from the domain name for the last character for your password and capitalize it. For example, you might add the third o from google, producing “ambrwv5O” or “pr5pccusO” for a GMail password. This ensures that even if
you use your password at multiple sites, anyone who steals the password can't use it another website unless they know the trick. You can also use this trick with your computer's password by choosing the third letter from the name you use for the computer, or for a password required for a software application, by using the third letter from the app's name.
</li>
<li>You should check the quality of your example password at <a href=http://www.passwordmeter.com/>Password Meter</a> -- “ambrwv5O” weight is 54%, which is pretty good for an 8-character password, “pr5pccusO” is 44%, which is OK, but both are significantly better because they will be different at every site.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The same technique can be used with longer words to create more secure financial passwords. These might be easier to remember if you use the first letters from a sentence or poem that you can remember to generate the initial phrase. For example, “My first pet's name was Arthur the Valiant Dog” would generate “MfpnwAtVD”. Again, you convert one or more letters to a number (“Mfpnw4tVD”). </p>

<p>When you add the domain letters to your secure password, you can strengthen it again by adding multiple letters, possibly to different parts of the password. For example, add the first and last letter the domain name. Thus a Google Gmail password might add a “G” to start and an “E” to the end, producing “GMfpnw4tVDE”. This one rates 70% at Password Meter, but again is actually better because of the site variation.<p>Also, most financial sites will accept, and some even require, passwords to include a symbol — I don't recommend this with your “non-secure” password as many ordinary sites do not allow symbols, but if you need one, then the following are some easy to remember substitutions: A=@, E=#, I=!, L=!, O=* S=$, or you can just put a symbol between the first domain letter and the passphrase (many sites will not allow a symbol at beginning or end). For example, password above could become “G$Mfpnw4tVDE” which raises this password's Password Meter rating to 90%.<p>With these two passwords you'll find it very easy to both remember and be secure against most password based attacks.</p>

<h3>A High-Tech Alternative</h3>

<p>An interesting high-security alternative that works best on webpages is to use <a href=http://supergenpass.com/>SuperGenPass Bookmarklet</a> — it takes the domain name plus a private master password and creates a unique high security password for each website based on a cryptographic hash of the two. It
can generate any length of password and you can't really get a password that is more secure, but there is the occasional web page that the bookmarklet doesn't work on. Fortunately, you can save <a href=http://supergenpass.com/mobile/>http://supergenpass.com/mobile/</a> as an .html file to your disk and you can open it anytime to manually create a supergenpass password for a website that you can copy and paste. I've even used SuperGenPass on my iPhone.</p>

<h3>Secondary Authentication</h3>

<p>Many sites require you to give them additional identification, such as mother's maiden name, the name of your pet, etc. Crackers have broken
into various celebrities accounts — such as Paris Hilton and Sarah Palin — by researching this information and asking for a password reset.</p>

<p>You can avoid this danger by treating these authentication requests like passwords. I have a standard word that I use for my mother's maiden name, my pet, etc. They're things that I can easily remember, but no one could figure out. Like the password technique above, I can easily add a letter from the domain. I've had no problem with customer service phone calls to banks; when they ask me for my mother's maiden name I just spell it out my encode word for them.</p>

<h3>Be Safe</h3>

<p>None of these approaches is perfect, but they significantly raise the bar against any but the most determined cracker from breaking into one
of your accounts. The domain letter technique will also make it very difficult for a cracker to break into your more important financial accounts if he gets access to your password from a poorly secured website or masquerades as a legitimate website or email by using a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing>phishing</a> attack.</p>

<p>However, don't ever think that a good password is the be-all and end-all of security. You also have to protect it adequately, and that doesn't just mean not writing it down, as mentioned above. You also must be alert to “social engineering”, where a cracker might call you or email you pretending to be associated with some institute where you might have an account.</p>

<p>Security is a constant game of oneupmanship between you and the black hats. Thus you need to ensure that you're always alert to the current best practices for setting, resetting, and protecting all of your security information on the internet.</p>

				<p><a href="http://worldatuningfork.com/John/medusaosxPDF.pdf#page=203" style="float: left;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577a68d970b-800wi alt="Poem: Language" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577a68d970b " border=0 title="Poem: Language"></a>We live in a world of conversation, of language; all full of words. Mastery of language requires learning the meanings of thousands of words. The average native English language speaker uses in the realm of 12,000 to 20,000 words, whereas a college graduate would use 20-25,000 words. Shakespeare actively used more then 30,000 words, and his vocabulary was estimated to be over 66,000 words. Yet there are, at the very least, a quarter of a million distinct English words, excluding inflections, and words from technical and regional vocabularies. The Oxford English dictionary defines more then 600,000 words.</p>

<p>But mastery of words is not enough to allow effective conversation.</p>

<p>That is because words themselves don't have meaning; the meaning is provided by the people who use them. Meaning is in the mind, not in the words.</p>

<p>Words also require context, outside of which they may have different meanings. For instance, consider the word "trust". To a banker or CPA "trust" is a property held by someone to manage for someone else's benefit. To a cryptographer it is the confidence in a future outcome based on probabilistic mathematics and past experience. Finally, to the lay person "trust" is about honesty. "Spin" is another example of a word that changes with context; to a weaver it is the production of thread, to a physicist it is a property of elemental particles, to an athlete it is a type of exercise class, and to a politician or public relations professional it is a way to tell a story to sway pubic opinion.</p>

<p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b-pi style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b-320pi alt="Life With Alacrity Wordle" title="Life With Alacrity Wordle" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b " style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language. They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience.</p>

<p>Don't forget that the linguistic root of communication is the Latin verb <a href=http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.18:3557.lewshort title="Latin definition of commūnĭco">commūnĭco</a>  — which doesn't mean "to communicate" but instead means "to share something with someone, to take or receive a part of, to partake, to participate in". Thus the creation of a shared language takes us to the roots of communication.</p>

<p>Without taking the time time to create shared language, groups have a difficult time forging mutual trust. Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something. Without a shared language commitments can be hard to make, and if misunderstood can lead to disagreements. These group formation phases — trust building, goal clarification, and commitment — are essential.</p>

<p>Yet the art of creating a shared language together is not taught. Some individuals and groups do it intuitively while others will just let it evolve naturally over time. However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact.</p>

<h4>Using Shared Artifacts</h4>

<p>A shared artifact is the creation of an object or shared space that is created collaboratively. It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: "Is this what you mean when you are talking about this? I use these words, so suppose we change it to this? Is that what you mean? Does this reflect our new shared understanding?"</p>

<p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c-pi style="float: left;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c-120pi alt=WatsonCrick title=WatsonCrick class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c " style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;"></a><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c-pi style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c-120wi alt=Napkin-idea-original-concept-300x293 class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c " style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a> Examples of shared artifacts include Watson &amp; Crick's Tinker-Toy DNA model. Each scientist would work on the model separately, then use grad students to carry the model around to his partner to express certain ideas. Both Compaq Computer and Southwest Airlines were reportedly established after their founders wrote their ideas down together on a table napkin, another shared artifact.</p>

<p>Both of these examples show an important factor in shared artifacts — if the shared artifact is not constrained then it will be too large or complex for the group to reach some measure of completion. Finishing the shared artifact really helps establish trust and the connections between the participants.</p>

<p>A shared artifact is also useful because flooding someone with information and terms gives no assurance that the recipient has gained knowledge of the subject. Instead, the act of creation confirms to both parties that the knowledge was successfully assimilated.</p>

<p>Another advantage to creating a shared artifact is that it isolates any problems to the task at hand. Often there are differences in status, purpose, or perspective that can get in the way of group formation, but a focus on a common task of the creation of a neutral shared artifact allows those issues to come later as the participants develop the trust and shared language required to talk about those tough issues.</p>

<p>The best facilitators know what kinds of shared artifacts work best for different groups under different circumstances. Sometimes a shared artifact is just a model of a process drawn on a white wall. Often it is a creation of a mission statement or joint objectives. I personally like taking old mind maps and trying to recreate them anew with more recent knowledge.</p>

<h4>The Future of Shared Language</h4>

<p>The nature of shared language is changing in the 21st century. The conjoined social networks in the blogosphere — via Facebook, Twitter, or the attendee-focused Unconference — cause new terminology and new language to form ever faster. I've personally seen words like "retweet" and "attribution" gain important contextual meaning within my social networks. As with any shared language, newcomers have difficulty discovering their meanings only by osmosis.</p>

<p>Tagging is another means by which shared language is rapidly expanding. Certain words are gaining context through common use at Delicious.com, Technorati, Flickr, and other tag-enabled web sites.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, all of these new shared languages are built upon shared artifacts. Twitter, Facebook, Delicious.com and others sites each create constraints on how language is shared and with whom. However, there is little purposeful social design being applied to these new shared languages. Though there may be shared artifacts, they are not purposefully facilitated.</p>

<p>Will these increasingly organic shared languages prove better than more purposefully created ones or worse? Is social language facilitation the next big thing in social network? Or is there just not enough space for it within the tightly constrained social artifacts of the internet? These are questions that we as social software technologists need to address as the future of the internet increasingly becomes the present of our social groupings.</p>

<p><em>(I learned the concept of Shared Language in 1990 from Michael Schrage's book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Shared-Minds-New-Technologies-Collaboration/dp/0394565878>Shared Minds: The New Technologies of Collaboration</a>. It is out of print, but there is a new edition retitled <a href=http://www.amazon.com/No-More-Teams-Mastering-Collaboration/dp/0385476035/>No More Teams!: Mastering the Dynamics of Creative Collaboration</a>. The use of a <a href=http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/glasbead/modexpl.htm>modeling language</a> to facilitate group formation I learned from <a href=http://www.matttaylor.com>Matt Taylor</a> (<a href=http://twitter.com/worthyprojects>@worthyprojects</a>) of <a href=http://www.mgtaylor.com/>MG Taylor Corporation</a>, though the use of the term shared artifacts and approach is my own. I make passing reference to the early stages of team formation ("trust building", "goal clarification", "commitment") which come from the <a href=http://www.grove.com/site/ourwk_gm_tp.html>Drexler/Sibbet Team Peformance Model</a>. The poem is by excerpt of a larger work by <a href=http://worldatuningfork.com/John/>John Campion</a> and is reprinted with permission — the work reflects the poet's Ecotropic concerns and are part of his third
book-length poem Medusa. Look at the work under the Medusa Project link. The table napkin photo is from an excellent post on <a href="http://createtheconditions.com/?p=304">The Idea Napkin</a> by Morry Potoka and is also reprinted with permission. The Watson-Crick photo is public domain, and the Life With Alacrity graphic was produced using <a href=http://www.wordle.net/>Wordle</a>.)</em></p>

				<p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a57769f5970b-pi style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a57769f5970b-800wi alt="Bgiedu seal 248x248" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a57769f5970b " border=0 title="Bgiedu seal 248x248"></a> Starting next week I will be teaching a course at the Bainbridge Graduate Institute on the topic of "Using the Social Web for Social Change".</p>

<p></p>
BGI offers an MBA and Certificate program for professionals to learn how to build enterprises that are financially successful, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. Students have to learn everything that they'd have to learn in an ordinary MBA program — profit and loss, how to read a balance sheet, business plan creation, macroeconomics, quantitative analysis, corporate strategy, how to manage and motivate people, and a basic understanding of all the components of business such as operations, marketing, distribution, sales, etc. In addition, BGI student have to learn green and sustainability topics — the triple-bottom line, environmental accounting, sustainable energy, social justice, systems thinking, organization change, right livelihood and much more.<p></p>
That broad a curriculum doesn't give students a lot of room for electives, but the MBA program allows for students to take one 3 credit hour course. This year students can choose from three: one course on social responsibility, a second course on climate change and carbon trading, and my course on the social web.<p></p>
The BGI pedagogy (a new term I have just learned, meaning "teaching method") is a mixed hybrid of online sessions along with a number of very intensive in-person classroom sessions. This allows the MBA student to continue working while taking classes in either a 2-year or 3-year program.<p></p><a href=http://www.channelrock.ca/ style="float: left;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5cdf579970c-120wi alt="The Cobb House at Channel Rock" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5cdf579970c " style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;"></a><a href=http://www.islandwood.org/ style="float: right;"><img src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5776c2e970b-120wi alt="The IslandWood Main Hall" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5776c2e970b " style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a> Students kick off their BGI experience at <a href=http://www.channelrock.ca/>Channel Rock</a> on Cortes Island in British Columbia, where the live for a week at an off-the-grid wilderness retreat, where they get the chance to experience and practice sustainability. Over the course of the year students and faculty meet in intensive classroom sessions for a 4-day weekend once a month at the  <a href=http://www.islandwood.org/>IslandWood</a> environmental learning center on <a href=http://www.bainbridgechamber.com/>Bainbridge Island</a> near Seattle, Washington. Between sessions, the classes utilize a variety of online distance-learning technologies such as <a href=http://www.elluminate.com/>Elluminate</a> to support student learning.<p></p>
I like this hybrid format because it fits my ideals of group formation — bonding and team building work best in the immersive, in-person experience, yet the online technologies allow students to have greater flexibility, deeper focus, and more control over their engagement while remote. BGI offers students both.<p></p>
When the class is complete, I plan to offer the syllabus, course plan, presentations, etc. online as open courseware, so that other schools can use these materials as a basis for future classes. In the meantime, expect to see some more posts here over the next few months.<p></p>
