				<p>I have for some time told people that one way that my blog was different was because I was focused on offering a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio>high signal-to-noise ratio</a>. I told them that they could subscribe to my blog safely, as I'd not inundate them with anything but the highest quality posts.</p>

<p>At first, this meant that I'd not post unless I had something significant to add to the topic. No simple pointers to interesting ideas, no simple rephrasing, or simple agreement -- I had to add value.</p>

<p>For some time I think I succeeded -- I received a lot of praise for my posts on social networking, on internet security, on FOAF, on the Dunbar number, and on my tool EditThisPagePHP. However, I've found that for each post my standards were growing higher. My most recent posts took significantly more time to write, and I believe were much more like articles then they are like the typical blog post.</p>

<p>I haven't posted now for a couple of months, and I realized this week that part of the problem is that I've become intimidated by my own standard. For every new post to meet the quality of some of my best posts is too difficult.</p>

<p>So I'm lowering my standards somewhat -- I will be posting some more small, pithy topics, rather then my longer rants. However, I do hope to continue to offer a good signal-to-noise ratio, and still add value.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>I have been leading the design of a new Open Source collaboration tool called <a href=http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index.php>EditThisPagePHP</a><a>, which started </a><a href=../../2003/12/editthispagephp.html>six months ago</a> and now is in beta.</p>

<p>My goal with EditThisPagePHP attempt to come close to <a href=http://www.scripting.com/>Dave Winer's</a> <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/discuss/msgReader$641?mode=topic">visionary statement</a> back in May of 1999:</p>

<blockquote><i>When I'm writing for the web, and I'm browsing my own site, every bit of text that I create has a button that says Edit This Page when I view it. When I click the button, a new page opens with the text in an HTML textarea. I edit. Click on Submit. The original page displays with the change. Three easy steps. The essential element is that *every* bit of text has this button. There can be no exceptions.</i></blockquote>

<p>At the fundamental level, EditThisPagePHP basically just let you remotely edit a single page. There are many situations where existing Wiki or Blog software is too complicated, or imposes too much structure. EditThisPagePHP lets you have total control over the HTML -- you can use sophisticated CSS layouts, or very simple HTML -- the software does not get in the way.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this simplicity, EditThisPagePHP also uses ideas drawn from various Wiki, Blog, and CMS (content management system) technologies. Like Wikis, it supports an edit-this-page button, page history, page diffs, and can email users when pages change. Like Blogs, it supports optional user comments, trackbacks (both send and receive), and delivers two RSS feeds -- one for the current version of the page, and one with diffs. Like a CMS, it supports multiple roles, by default a reader, an editor, and a super-editor -- each with different privileges.</p>

<p>I personally plan to use it for standards documents, lists, game rules, and home pages for various groups I collaborate with. I expect that others will use it anytime a group of people want to maintain a publicly accessible page together.</p>

<p>Some screenshots:</p>

<p><b>Technical Details:</b> EditThisPagePHP is written solely in PHP, and it currently works with PHP 4 and 5, and does not require SQL. Every revision makes a backup of itself, so no data can be lost. PHP is not allowed in the HTML text itself, to minimize security risks. Only two files are required: the core PHP script (editthispage.php) and a data file for your page. The core file can support as many pages as desired. The current version is <a href=http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/editthispagephp/editthispage-0.5b2.zip?download>0.5b2</a>, is licensed under a BSD-style license, and there is a <a href=http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/demo_05b2/index.php>working sandbox demo</a> available to play with.</p>

<p>Future goals are to support more technical features, without losing the elegance and simplicity of the implementation. This may include limited Wiki TextFormatting or a simple WYSIWYG editor, HTML-tidy, some user-interface enhancements, etc. A complete list is available on our <a href=http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/wishlist.php>wishlist</a> page.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>I've been thinking about the nature of privacy a lot lately.</p>

<p>I've long been associated with issues of preserving privacy. I helped with anti-Clipper Chip activism in the early 90s and supported various efforts to free cryptography such as PGP and other tools built with RSAREF from export control. However, my efforts in these areas wasn't really focused on privacy -- instead my focus was on issues of trust.</p>

<p>I've always tried to be precise here. For instance, one of the uses of the SSL encryption software that I designed and sold at Consensus Development was to preserve privacy; however, I never sold it with privacy as a feature. Instead I clearly stated that SSL offered "message integrity", "confidentiality" and "authentication". Part of the reason that I never used the word privacy with SSL was that I felt that the concept of privacy was too overloaded -- or possibly orthogonal to issues of cryptographic security. Promising privacy was promising too much.</p>

<p>More recently issues of privacy have been coming up in my study of social software. It got started with <a href=../../2004/02/confirmed_email.html>my post about privacy issues in Orkut</a> and a general <a href=../../2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html>insecurity and discomfort</a> with information made available in various social networking services. Later I wrote about <a href=../../2004/02/handcrafting_my.html>handcrafting my FOAF</a> which required me to re-think how and what information I wished to reveal about myself. More recently I was <a href=../../2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html>stung by Zero Degrees</a> which still disturbs me greatly.</p>

<p>All of this has stewed in my head until I arrived at the <a href=http://www.cfp2004.org>Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference</a> this week here in Berkeley, where I met many of my friends and colleagues in the cryptographic security business, as well as advocates on issues of privacy in organizations such as <a href=http://www.eff.org>EFF</a> and <a href=http://www.epic.org>EPIC</a>. My thoughts have now gelled sufficiently to make some observations about privacy.</p>

<p>When people speak about privacy, they may actually be talking about very different forms of privacy: defensive privacy, human-rights privacy, personal privacy, and contextual privacy.</p>

<p><em>Defensive privacy</em> is the first form: it's about protecting information about myself that makes me vulnerable or makes me feel at risk. This type of information can include things like my social security number, my credit report, or non-financial things such as my medical records or my home address. For some of my female friends this includes things like their photographs and email addresses. All of this information can be misused by other individuals or organizations in one way or another to mess up my life -- and in fact defensive privacy is usually centered around protecting this critical information from those singular individuals or organizations, be they con men, stalkers, or the Mafia. Most of the current privacy issues on the Internet seem to fall into this category. This form of privacy has also not fared well in the US courts -- for instance, in 1974 the Supreme Court decided that your bank records belong to the bank, to do with as they see fit.</p>

<p>Closely intersecting defensive privacy is the category of <em>human-rights privacy</em>. When you are speaking with a European about privacy, this often is the type of privacy they are speaking of. This comes from their history: the Netherlands in the 1930s had a very comprehensive administrative census and registration of their own population, and this information was captured by the Nazis within the first three days of occupation. Thus Dutch Jews had the highest death rate (73 percent) of Jews residing in any occupied western European country -- far higher than the death rate among the Jewish population of Belgium (40 percent) and France (25 percent). Even the death rate in Germany was less then the Netherlands because the Jews there had avoided registration. (source: <a href=http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m2267/2_68/77187772/p4/article.jhtml>The Dark Side of Numbers</a>). Human-rights privacy differs from defensive privacy in that it is about how governments can abuse information, rather then individuals abusing information. I used to feel safe about human-rights privacy in the US, that there was no way that what happened in Europe could happen here, but now I have lost such confidence because of Bush and Ashcroft.</p>

<p>The third kind of privacy, <em>personal privacy</em>, is more unique to the United States. It is what Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in 1890 called "the right to be left alone". This form of privacy is often what the more Libertarian-oriented founders of the Internet mean when they talk about privacy. Personal privacy covers things like the "do not call registry", the various rights to do as we please in our own houses -- such as view pornography or play S&amp;M games with our partners -- and the general right to not be interrupted or interfered with unnecessarily at home. This form of privacy has more basis in US law; the concept is based on an interpretation of the First, Fourth, and Fifth amendments of the US Constitution, but is not explicitly defined there. However, this form of privacy is guaranteed by the State of California Constitution which assures residents that they may pursue and obtain <a href=http://www.privacy.ca.gov/code/declaration.htm>safety, happiness, and privacy</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>contextual privacy</em> is what <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/>Danah Boyd</a> calls the <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/04/14/why_privacy_issues_matter_to_me.html#004117>ickiness factor</a> in her blog, and also in her post at <a href='http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/04/16/the_ickiness_factor.php"'>Many-To-Many</a>:<blockquote><em>Ickiness is the guttural reaction that makes you cringe, scrunch your nose or gasp "ick" simply because there’s something slightly off, something disconcerting, something not socially right about an interaction.</em></blockquote><p>This category is very difficult to define, and is easily confused with other forms of privacy, but I believe it has more to do with an inappropriate level of intimacy. An example of this is when I discovered that my professional colleagues on Orkut could see that I was in a committed relationship, and in turn I could see that some of them were in open marriages. I don't think there is very much harm that can come from this information being revealed, however, it was "icky" because it was an inappropriate level of intimacy for a professional context.</p>

<p>All four of these forms of privacy can intersect -- for instance, Orkut allows you to reveal your sexual orientation, which could be used secretly by an employer to discriminate against you (defensive privacy), or by a future Ashcroftian government to violate your civil rights (human-rights privacy), might lead you to being bothered at home because of people who either agree with or disagree with your orientation (personal privacy), and often is inappropriate for casual professional acquaintances to be told about (contextual privacy).</p>

<p>I don't think any of this answers the question of how to solve problems of privacy, but I do believe that it can help when you are discussing privacy to be sure that you try to convey and understand each others' ideas of what privacy means.</p>

				<p>As I'm studying social network software right now, I consider it my job to try many of the <a href=http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/2241460714746671/>hundred some odd social networks </a>out there right now.</p>

<p>I just joined <a href=http://www.zerodegrees.com>Zero Degrees</a>, and like many others, it asked me to upload my address book. I've done this before and usually it just finds those who already have joined these networks and links us together. Typically I delete my address book at this point, and don't bother to invite contacts that are not already members of that particular network.</p>

<p>However, Zero Degrees quite obnoxiously at the last "next" button, with no warning, invited <b>everyone</b> in my address book, and thus spamming my contacts. There was no opportunity given to me for it to just search for existing members. I aborted this as soon as I could, but about half of my address book contacts got spammed.</p>

<p>This probably explains some of the invitations that I've gotten from others that I didn't expect, thus I suspect that I'm not the only one that this has happened to.</p>

<p>So my apologies if you received "Yet Another Invite to Yet Another Social Networking Service" from me. I do not invite my collegues to <b>ANY</b> of these social networking services unless they ask me to, or they are already a member.</p>

<p>Thus if you are planning on experimenting with Zero Degrees, I don't recommend that you upload your contacts. I'm going to be a lot more careful with Zero Degrees in the future, and every other new service.</p>

<p><em>[update: It looks like <a href=http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/003050.html>Stowe Boyd got stung</a> by Zero Degrees as well, and Ross Mayfield has a <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/04/15/how_to_achieve_zero_degrees_of_separation.php>good screen shot of the "next" button</a> that caused the problem. Read the fine print!]</em></p>

				<p>While I've been out attending the <a href=http://www.sxsw.com>SXSW Music, Movie and Interactive Conference</a> there has been a flurry of high-quality postings about Social Networking.</p>

<p>Unlike many of my fellow bloggers, I find it difficult to post meaningful blogs while I'm on the road. It has been my policy in my own blog postings to also be "high-signal, low-noise", so normally I don't just post links without solid additional commentary, however, I'm making an exception this time because of the quality and depth of these entries.</p>

<h4>How Do We Categorize Relationships</h4>

<p>Clay Shirky writes in Many to Many <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/03/16/relationship_a_vocabulary_for_describing_relationships_between_people.php>RELATIONSHIP: A vocabulary for describing relationships between people</a> which is a commentary on a new proposal for <a href=http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/>mapping relationships</a> in <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a> (see also my previous blog on <a href=../../2004/02/handcrafting_my.html>FOAF</a>):<p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Here, just in case you were wondering, is how you should be characterizing your relationships with one another:</p>

<p>friendOf, acquaintanceOf, parentOf, siblingOf, childOf, grandchildOf, spouseOf, enemyOf, antagonistOf, ambivalentOf, lostContactWith, knowsOf, wouldLikeToKnow, knowsInPassing, knowsByReputation, closeFriendOf, hasMet, worksWith, colleagueOf, collaboratesWith, employerOf, employedBy, mentorOf, apprenticeTo, livesWith, neighborOf, grandparentOf, lifePartnerOf, engagedTo, ancestorOf, descendantOf, participantIn, participant</p>

</i><p><i>Describing relationships with a controlled vocabulary can sound credible right up to the moment you see the vocabulary, but this thing is a mess.<br>
...<br>
The RELATIONSHIP list should make it obvious that explicit linguistic clarity in human relations is a pipe dream. It probably won’t though — the madness of the age is to assume that people can spell out, in explicit detail, the messiest aspects of their lives, and that they will eagerly do so, in order to provide better inputs to cool new software.
</i></blockquote>

<p>Make sure you read the comment's in Clay Shirky's blog entry -- some good discussion.</p>

<p>Ian Davis writes a response to Clay's posting in <a href=http://internetalchemy.org/2004/03/clayShirkyOnRELATIONSHIP>Clay Shirky on Relationship</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>There are a number of themes in Clay's post. The primary theme appears to be one of completeness: Clay's thesis is that the vocabulary is incomplete because it doesn't provide properties to model composite relationships: what if you are employed by a colleague you collaborate with?. Clay seems to be implying that he expects the terms to be exclusive. Of course they're not. It's perfectly meaningful to assert that Jane employedBy John and Jane collaboratesWith John. RDF supports this kind of assertion and you can also express it with the HTML method outlined in the vocabulary.<br>
...<br>
Obviously I'm pleased that Clay has taken the vocabulary seriously enough to critique in detail. Somehow the thought that everyone would ignore it caused me more concern than the fear that everyone would hate it.</p>

<p>Despite all the obvious thought Clay put into his piece, he still managed to overlook the raison d'etre for the relationship vocabulary. Indeed it's the raison d'etre for all vocabularies. Without these vocabularies, incomplete and imperfect as they are, we would be mute in the machine readable web, unable to express ourselves in any meaningful way. You only have to look at the etymology to realise that vocabularies give you a voice.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Like Clay I too am concerned with this relationship proposal, for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>First, I'm not sure that I like the "negative" relationships. There is a good argument against using negative relationships in the <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn/background#positive>XFN Background</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Negative relationship terms have been omitted from XFN by design.  The authors think that such values would not serve a positive ends and thus made the deliberate decision to leave them out. Such terms (we won't even bother naming them here) while mildly entertaining in a dark humor sort of way, only serve to propagate negativity.</p>

<p>The authors do not deny that such negative relationships exist in the real world today.  Of course they exist.  However, we see no need nor benefit to standardizing such relationships and capturing them in a form which would spread on the Web.  There is enough hatred in the world.  We should work to eliminate hatred, not to spread it.</p>

<p>And we do realize that by creating <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn>XFN</a> and the mechanisms it uses (<a href=http://gmpg.org/xmdp/>XMDP</a>), we have opened a Pandora's box, and have made it easier for those that would create and propagate negative relationships.  We can only hope that our positive creation wins out over any such negative creations.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Secondly, I am uncomfortable with both the relationships in <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a> and parallel ideas in <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn>XFN</a> because they in both proposals these are "exposed" publicly. I am comfortable with saying that I "knowOf" someone, but when forced to categorize publicly everyone even more precisely, I become uncomfortable. Am a I committing a faux-pas when I say that I am a "friendOf" someone when they think I'm a "closeFriendOf"?</p>

<p>Lastly, I'm concerned about complexity -- once you start down the slippery slope of defining relationships, things can get incredibly complex. Even if don't include concerns about ethnocentricity (as <a href=http://www.michael.bauser.name/20031225T045828Z>Michael Bauser writes</a>), there just seems to be no end in sight to how specific you might be required to be. Becoming more specific typically results in more precision, but in this case, as these are very fluid human (or even primate) definitions, wrought with emotion, may result in them being less precise. Maybe the real answer should be much simpler four: knowsOf, professionalColleagueOf, personalFriendOf, and shareFamilyWith.</p>

<h4>Are Social Networks Useful?</h4>

<p>Judith Meskill asks in <a href=http://www.meskill.net/archives/000565.html>Musings On Autonomic Social &amp; Knowledge Networks</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>If you utilize one or more of the current entrants in this swell of online SNS offerings [such as LinkedIn, Friendster, Orkut, Ryze, and/or Tribe] - what value, if any, do you derive from them? And, harkening back to the citation with which I started this post, has one [or more] of these services assisted in helping you to successfully reduce the 'traffic congestion' at the 'intersections' in your life? And, in closing, any insights, comments, or ponderings on the recent and future blurring of lines between 'wetware,' 'software,' and 'hardware' in an infinitely connected wireless world?</i></blockquote>

<p>Stuart Henshall answers in Unbound Spiral <a href=http://www.henshall.com/blog/archives/000817.html>Social Networking is Broken</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>This slightly facetious statement: "My social networks are broken... at least I think they are." reflects my conclusion that the social networks I've been playing in are for the most part associative networks. While they have a social element the socializing for the most part takes place by blogs, forums, IM / e-mail, phone and in face to face visits.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It's time to put a stop to categorizing these "things" as social networks. Call them "Associative Networking Tools" or "Structured Association Tools" or something similar. Then you can create a bucket for them. The reason there is no real business model is they are just part of / or component towards building our capabilities to enhance "presence" and connectivity.</p>

<p>What have we learned.</p>

<ul><li>We don't socialize rather only associate through the Orkuts while we socialize using messaging, telephone and face to face visits.</li>

<li>The opportunity to connecting through friends is much greater than generally understood. Some successes have been achieved. </li>

<li>Virtual connections mean managing ones connections and presence has never been more important. </li>

<li>Structured services are creating problems where there were none before. From categories to access. And designating "artificial" forced levels of buddies or friendship.</li>

<li>Fragmenting association systems does not enable better connections.</li> 

<li>Integration on to my desktop (address book / IM systems) at minimum and preferably into my cellphone is required for there are few you can synch with and while one can upload addresses you can seldom download. </li>

<li>The sites themselves are seldom responsible for the association, the connective knowledge is broader than the networking sites. eg blogs, blogrolls, online forums etc.</ul>
</i></blockquote>

Denise Klarquist writes in <a href=http://weblog.cheskin.net/blog/archives/000216.html>SNAM - Too much of a good thing?</a> (via <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a394>Dinah Mehta</a>):

<blockquote><i>Each time I'm invited to join or add someone (frequently unknown to me) to my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/>Linkedin</a> network, or asked to update my contact information via <a href=http://www.plaxo.com/>Plaxo</a> (again, usually by someone I barely know) I wonder how far my online social network extends. And how useful it really is. I'm still intrigued and excited by the possibilities of online social networking. But I'm hoping to see more of the benefits before the noise dampens my enthusiasm.</i></blockquote>

<p><a href=http://www.chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/>Chris Corrigan</a> offers a similar concern in a comment in Dinah Mehta's blog <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a395>Social Networking - Too Much Noise?</a>:

<blockquote><i>
<p>"Seems to me that social networks have a hard time existing in the absence of a reason to do so. I have played around on Ryze and Orkut and to be honest they hold no glamour for me. I have a number of real life social networks from whence my business comes, and my weblog provides me with another social network from which I derive a lot of learning.</p>

<p>But I could never find a reason for the Ryze's and Orkuts of the world. And without a reason to network, networking becomes just noise.</p>

<p>One application for these types of things that I am working with a little is using social networking software to support emerging Aboriginal leaders here in British Columbia Canada who are working on interesting things in remote and far flung communities and who will really benefit from have some contact with each other. </p>

<p>But I wouldn't dream of inviting them to Ryze. Interesting, eh?"</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>Lately I've been noticing the spread of a meme regarding "Dunbar's Number" of 150 that I believe is misunderstanding of his ideas.</p>

<h3>The Science of Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Dunbar is an anthropologist at the University College of London, who wrote a paper on <a href=http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/05/65/bbs00000565-00/bbs.dunbar.html>Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans</a> where he hypothesizes:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... there is a cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships, that this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this in turn limits group size ... the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained.</em></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar supports this hypothesis through studies by a number of field anthropologists. These studies measure the group size of a variety of different primates; Dunbar then correlate those group sizes to the brain sizes of the primates to produce a mathematical formula for how the two correspond. Using his formula, which is based on 36 primates, he predicts that 147.8 is the "mean group size" for humans, which matches census data on various village and tribe sizes in many cultures. The following chart shows the distribution produced by Dunbar's analysis:</p>

<p align=center><img src=http://www.bcg.com/images/this_is_bcg/strategy_institute/brain_size_02.gif><br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Source: <a href=http://www.bcg.com/strategy_institute_gallery/gorilla3.asp>Boston Consulting Group</a></span></p>

<p>This number of 150 has become "Dunbar's Number" and has been popularized by various very popular business books such as Malcolm Gladwell's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a> (<a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0111705/categories/collaboration/2003/12/21.html#a358>summary</a>), Duncan J. Watts' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041425/ref=pd_skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age</a> (<a href=http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/reviews/Podolny/>review</a>) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691005419/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Small Worlds: The Dynamics of Networks between Order and Randomness</a> (<a href=http://www.ams.org/notices/200008/rev-chow.pdf>review</a>), and Mark Buchanan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041530/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks</a> (<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/16209;jsessionid=baadd3W3trYipI">review</a>), the ideas from which are the foundation of the various Social Network Services that I've discussed elsewhere in this blog.</p>

<h3>Revisiting Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Lately, Dunbar's number has been taken as a mean size for online networks and groups, as shown in <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/02/12.html#a284>Ross Mayfield's Weblog</a>, where he states:

<blockquote>
<table border=1><tr>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Network</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Size</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Description</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Distribution</span></strong></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Political Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~1000s</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as mass media</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Power-law (scale-free)</span></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Social Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~150</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogging Classic</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Bell-curve (random)</span></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Creative Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~12</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as dinner conversation</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Dense (equal)</span></table>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Dunbar's work itself suggests that a community size of 150 will not be a mean for a community unless it is highly incentivized to remain together. We can see hints of this in Dunbar's description of the number and what it means:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The group size predicted for modern humans by equation (1) would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.<br>
...<br>
My suggestion, then, is that language evolved as a "cheap" form of social grooming, so enabling the ancestral humans to maintain the cohesion of the unusually large groups demanded by the particular conditions they faced at the time.</em></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar's theory is that this 42% number would be true for humans if humans had not invented language, a "cheap" form of social grooming. However, it does show that for a group to sustain itself at the size of 150, significantly more effort must be spent on the core socialization which is necessary to keep the group functioning. Some organizations will have sufficient incentive to maintain this high level of required socialization. In fact the traditional villages and historical military troop sizes that Dunbar analyzed are probably the best examples of such an incentive, since they were built upon the raw need for survival. However, this is a tremendous amount of effort for a group if it's trying not just to maintain cohesion, but also to get something done.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Dunbar specifically restricts himself to physically close groups:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.</em></blockquote>

<p>My anecdotal evidence generally seems to support the idea that group sizes will usually plateau at a number lower than 150 participants. This comes from 20 years of doing facilitation both on and offline, running several software companies, and running various forums at America Online. In particular, many online communities provide good evidence for Dunbar's Number actually being an upper limit (either due to reduced efficiency or due to increased dispersion).</p>

<h3><a name=onlinecommunities>Dunbar &amp; Online Communities</a></h3>

<p><em>Ultima Online</em> provides one of the best examples of what sizes an online community will support because it's well documented and the overall game size is large enough to generate many smaller communities. If you look at <a href=http://www.legendmud.org/raph/>Raph Koster's</a> statistics for the size of groups in <em>Ultima Online</em>, you will see a definite point of diminishing returns at around 150; however, you will also see that most groups are around 60 large.</p>

<p align=center><img src=../../UOGuildPowerLaw.jpg alt="UO Guild Power Law"></p>

<p align=center><img src=../../UOGuildHistogram.jpg alt="UO Guild Histogram"></p>

<p>Jessica Mulligan, executive producer at <a href=http://www.turbinegames.com/>Turbine Games</a>, confirmed these numbers to me:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The numbers match up with my (currently) mostly anecdotal evidence for <a href=http://ac.turbingames.com>Asheron's Call</a>.  We have allegiances in the hundreds and even thousands of members, but most of those members are inactive, non-participatory in the group on a regular basis or are mule accounts for farming XP.  It is rare to have more than 40 or so active participants in an Allegiance.</em></blockquote>

<p>I've seen similar limits myself in some of the small online games that <a href=http://www.skotos.com>Skotos</a> produces. For instance, in <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach>Castle Marrach</a>, which is a social-dominant game (i.e. like a MUSH), the game grew quickly until we reached approximately 150-200 active users. However, whenever it grew beyond that number, it always seemed that politics and dissatisfaction would bubble up such that people would drop out, leaving us back close to 150 or 160. (That we would ever exceed 150 is a bit of a surprise, but I think it's due to any number of factors, including a variable 24-hour user base, wherein on a given day we might only see a little more then half of our community members, below Dunbar's Number, and only get up to close to 200 or so over a full week.)</p>

<p>We have had some games at Skotos that do manage to overcome Dunbarrian social limits, prime among them <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/eternal-city>The Eternal City</a> which regularly exceeds the Marrach community by more then double. However, TEC is a much more achievement-oriented game, meaning that people spend much of their time interacting with the environment -- fighting monsters and training skills as it happens -- rather than directly interacting with other players all the time. Thus social limits become less important.</p>

<p>Other online communities that I've had experience with have been more traditional, and thus more closely met my expectations for Dunbar's Number acting as a limit rather than a mean. When I managed the Mac Developer's Forum community on AOL, a forum would start to break down when it reached about 80 active contributors, requiring a forum split before continued growth could occur. Wikis provide another good example; the WikiPedia, one of the largest active Wikis online, appears to have hovered at approximately 150-175 <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators>active administrators</a> for over a year, in spite of a huge growth in usage during the same period.</p>

<p>These numbers just keep coming up.</p>

<p>This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time "grooming" to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don't have <a href=http://www.doceo.co.uk/background/requisite_variety.htm>requisite variety</a>.</p>

<p>

Thus Dana Boyd gets it right when she uses the word MAXIMUM in her <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/11/my_etech_talk_revenge_of_the_user.html>eTech Talk</a>, not average or mean:

<blockquote><p><em>[Dunbar] found that the MAXIMUM number of people that a person could keep up with socially at any given time, gossip maintenance, was 150. This doesn't mean that people don't have 150 people in their social network, but that they only keep tabs on 150 people max at any given point.</em></blockquote>

<h3>Expanding Dunbar's Numbers</h3>

<p>To open up the discussion a bit, I'd also hypothesize that Dunbar's Number is just one datapoint in an overall equation describing what group sizes work and what don't. Working our way up from the smallest group sizes, I think we can find many break points, both above and below Dunbar's Number of 150.</p>

<p>In my experience the smallest viable group size seems to be somewhere in the range of 5 to 9.</p>

<p>Looking smaller, we see that a group of 2 can be tremendously creative (ask any parent), but often has insufficient resources and thus requires deep commitment by both parties. Notably, often the difficulty of a 2-person business partnership is compared to that of a marriage. A group of 3 is often unstable, with one person feeling left out, or else one person controlling the others by being the "split" vote. A group of 4 often devolves into two pairs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of "team" really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough "attention" is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Although I've been unable to find the source, I've heard of some references to a study from the 1950s that says that the optimum size for a committee is 7. Likewise, it's fairly easy for us to see and agree that a dinner party starts to break down somewhere above 7 or 8 people, as do also tabletop games of both the strategic (I prefer 5) and role-playing varieties (I prefer 7). These size limits can be overcome, but require increased amounts of "grooming". </p>

<p>The chasm that starts somewhere between 9 to 12 people can be especially daunting for a small business. As you grow past 12 or so employees, you must start specializing and having departments and direct reports; however, you are not quite large enough for this to be efficient, and thus much employee time that you put toward management tasks is wasted. Only as you approach and pass 25 people does having simple departments and managers begin to work again, as it starts to really make sense for department heads to spend significant time just communicating and coordinating (and as individual departments become large enough to once again allow for the dynamic exchange of ideas that had previously occurred in the original 5-9 member seed group).</p>

<p>I've already noted the next chasm when you go beyond 80 people, which I think is the point that Dunbar's Number actually marks for a non-survival oriented group. Even at this lower point, the noise level created by required socialization becomes an issue, and filtering becomes essential. As you approach 150 this begins to be unmanageable. Once a company grows past 200 you are really starting to need middle-management, but often you can't afford it yet. Only when you get up past that, maybe at 350-500 people, does middle-management start really working, primarily because you've once again segmented your original departments, possibly again reducing them to Dunbar-sized groups.</p>

<p>The following chart shows anecdotal satisfaction ratings for these lower group sizes:</p>

<p align=center><img src=../../GroupSatisfaction.jpg alt="Group Satisfaction"></p>

<p>Much of this is probably predicted by Dunbar's model, if you add in the non-survival and dispursed community modifiers that I discuss here. Essentially, as we increase group sizes beyond 80, to 150, 200, or even 350-500, we typically do so by breaking larger groups down into smaller ones, and continually reducing community sizes down to the point where they can be understood and managed by people -- and so efficiency reasserts itself.</p><br>

                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>I spent most of last week at the RSA Conference in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Like last year, I found little that excited me. I overheard from a convention staffer that they had 30% more attendees, so the conference is growing again, but my week there also reinforced my opinions regarding the industry as a whole as I describe in my previous blog posting <a href=../../2004/02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a>.</p>

<p>I asked a number of random people what they thought of the conference. Some agreed with me, saying that they were troubled by the lack of innovation. Others said that they actually liked it -- it showed that the industry was being run by businessmen finally, and not by geeks. Others said that it was just the inevitable maturation of an industry. Tim Oren wrote in his blog <a href=http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2004/02/27.html#a565>Due Diligence</a>:<blockquote>Every year the show is less about cryptography per se. I'm sure this has something to do with RSA's attempts to diversify as its patents expire, but I do think it reflects the state of the field. Crypto has become a standardized component of security solutions, and the biggest perceived threats are not in the privacy area.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The hilight of the conference to me was hearing respected cryptographer Whitfield Diffie say to me that he had read my <a href=../../2004/02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a> and that he liked it. Apparently it had been sent to him by someone at Sun who had thought that it was saying many of the things that Diffie has been saying as well. Diffie said that he had some specific criticisms, so I hope that he'll comment here someday on them.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Caller-ID for Email</h4><p></p>

<p>The big announcement of the week was that Microsoft will be be releasing their own spam solution, a <a href=http://windows-help.net/cgi-bin/2004/7.08.cgi?70801>Caller ID</a> for email addresses, starting this summer in HotMail and in their mail servers. Basically the way this works is that every domain holder publishes inside their DNS records the IP addresses of any valid outbound email server. This information is stored using XML in a special signed format. After a mail is sent, the receiving system queries the DNS to confirm that the outbound server is not being spoofed.</p>

<p>This is a very similar technique to what a number of other companies are proposing, for instance AOL is backing a proposal called <a href=http://spf.pobox.com/execsumm.html>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> or sometimes "Sender Permitted From", and Yahoo is backing <a href=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1430976,00.asp>Domain Keys</a>. Unfortunately, Microsoft's Caller-ID proposal requires XML, which makes implementation much more complicated. It requires the entire email to be received by the server first, before looking up the DNS record, then validating a signature -- all of which introduces more burdens on the mail server. Lastly, this XML may exceed the 512-character limit for DNS requests, which can cause DNS servers to send via TCP rather then UDP, which may introduces even more uncertainty.</p>

<p>It is good to see that Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo are taking spam seriously, but I do worry that that the burden of supporting more then one of these standards may be significant. This could mean that only large corporations, educational institutions, and ISPs could host email, whereas small companies, third-world organizations, and individuals could not. I would prefer that one solution be broadly and easily adopted. <font color=red><s>Daniel Goldman</s></font> <font color=green>Yakov Shafranovich</font> in <a href=http://www.shaftek.org/blog/archives/000061.html>NetWizard's blog</a> is also concerned about patent claims and lack of IETF participation:<blockquote>At the same time none of these proposals have been submitted to any standards bodies such as the <a href=http://www.ietf.org>IETF</a>, and as a matter of fact <a href=https://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/asrg/current/msg09082.html>Microsoft was invited</a> to submit "Caller ID" and participate in <a href=http://www.ietf.org/ietf/04mar/marid.txt>this week's meeting at the IETF on the subject</a>, but <a href=http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg00023.html>they declined</a>. At the same time the community had jumped on Caller ID's patent license by declaring a (and <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/02/26/1448253&amp;mode=thread">a possible incompatibility with the GPL</a>). Of course it remains to be seen what exactly does Caller ID claim to patent since RMX and other prior art existed at least since 1998, and if Caller ID ever makes it to the IETF, Microsoft will have to deal with <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3669.txt>the new IPR guidelines (RFC 3669)</a> which favor non-patented technologies.</blockquote>I'm also not convinced that even if these techniques are deployed (Gartner group <a href=http://informationweek.securitypipeline.com/news/18201583>predicts</a> less then 25% will implement these in the next two years) that they will not return us to early 1990's levels of spam, only just slow down the onslaught. For instance, in a similar fashion to current WiFi war-chalking, a spammer could wait until an authenticated user logged in a mail server and hijack that connection. Unless the link is encrypted and authenticated, it is possible for a spammer to impersonate the legitimate user without anyone being the wiser. Related, these techniques do not necessarily help with the growing threat of "phishing" -- emails that lure unsuspecting users to enter credit card or bank account information into fake web sites.<p></p>

<p>I am also concerned that all of these standards require some measure of public-key infrastructure, including management of public-keys, which many security analysts believe that we are not doing a good enough job now.</p>

<p>There is some good thoughtful analysis of these three standards by Larry Seltzer of eWeek in <a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,1761,a=120536,00.asp">Who will Win the SMTP Authentication Wars</a>.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>More Security in Windows XP SP2</h4><p></p>

<p>Bill Gates also discussed new security features in the upcoming Windows XP SP2. In addition to some interesting "Active Protection Technology" to prevent overflow attacks, he discussed built-in virus protection and an improved built-in firewall that also warns of outbound connections.</p>

<p>Out in the hall I heard some people saying that announcement was a good basis for selling Symantec short, while others countered that Microsoft never gets these type of things right and there would always be business for Symantec. Companies that offer more minor features like preventing browser popups will be hurt. However, as these solutions are already free and ubiquitous, this is one of the few cases where I prefer for these to be in the default Microsoft install. However, I do worry for the smaller but more innovative security vendors like ZoneAlarm.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Sessions</h4><p></p>

<p>Over the years the sessions at RSA have become more managerial and corporate in nature, but there were a couple of good technical sessions that I attended or friends commented on.</p>

<p>I was pleased by the Cryptographer's Panel response to Bill Gates' announcements: "We have a lot of great levers in cryptography, but we're missing the OSes and platforms that can really serve our keys," said Ronald Rivest. "Bill Gates didn't talk about simplifying things, but that's the only way we are going to get security. We're not smart enough to handle the complexity of this stuff. You have to get the complexity out of there," continued Paul Kocher. Whitfield Diffie criticized security the upcoming Windows Longhorn release because "For the first time, you will have a PC that does NOT do what you tell it to." </p>

<p>The Cryptographer's Panel also spoke on the topic of electronic voting, and supported calls for paper ballots to supplement and verify votes cast with new electronic voting technology. Rivest cautioned "We know only too well the difficulties of securing complex electronic systems."</p>

<p>I also heard good things about the "Hacking VM Machines" and "Analyzing Topologies of Trust" sessions, and the closing keynote by PJ O'Rouke, but I missed them -- anyone have any notes? Where there some other good sessions I missed?</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Exhibits</h4><p></p>

<p>The exhibit floor was again a bit droll for me.  Like in previous years the floor was dominated by vendors selling rather high-end corporate systems that might have excited me more if I was in the market for one, but I was looking for less expensive systems for smaller businesses. Like last year there were lots of dedicated devices, such as firewalls, spam prevention, VPN and intrusion detection hardware, and fewer companies offering software to use with my existing hardware.</p>

<p>I did like some of the biometric hard drives, but investigating more deeply I just can't trust them yet. No one yet offers a good solution for redundant key storage yet for these, as a backup in case of a physical failure.</p>

<p>I did see one company <a href=http://www.authenex.com>Authenex</a> that was offering free USB keys that supposedly allow you to encrypt files on your system and email them to someone else with a different key -- it looks like some public key technique is being used, with the key serving as a pre-generated private key storage. More interestingly, they claim that if you register your USB key at their website, they can send you a replacement key that you can use to decrypt your old files. I'll have to do some more investigation of the technology behind this, and if they've had adequate study by cryptographers that I trust. If they have, and they start offering storage on those keys as well, they may have something useful that I'll buy.</p>

<p>RSA had an demo of it's <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/company/news/releases/pr.asp?doc_id=3376">prototype RFID blocker tag</a> that they suggest is a possible solution to some of the fears that some of us privacy advocates have been worrying about. <a href=http://scottmace.typepad.com/imanager/2004/02/cool_demo_rsa_r.html>Scott Mace</a> has a good description of the demo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each booth visitor selects from one of three demo prescriptions -- "tranquility pills," "wisdom pills," or "happiness pills." (I chose wisdom, naturally.) The RSA Labs crew requests a name from the visitor, then hands over an appropriately-tagged bottle (mine contained jellybeans). They scan the bottle on an RFID tabletop scanner and visitors see the details of the prescription, including type of prescription and patient's name. Then, they insert the bottle into an ordinary paper pharmacy bag that happens to contain a paper "blocker tag" that then blocks any attempt for an RFID reader to scan the bottle while it's in the bag.</blockquote><p>
Though a cool demo, I'm not as confident that this solution will work. Now in addition to the previous "foil bag" theft techniques, what prevents someone from building one of these into a watch or a PDA? Sending a signal to burn-out the RFID is one of the other proposals out there, it has similar problems -- what if someone goes into a WalMart and burns-out every RFID in the place?

<p>RSA was also demoing its latest SecurID integration with Windows, which will extend the life of this security token for RSA customers for many years. I spoke to Scott Schnell, VP of Marketing, afterwards at a party and he explained to me some of the details of how they made it work with Windows laptops. Apparently the system will cache up to several weeks worth of SecurID information such that the laptop owner can use his SecurID token to log on to his laptop even though he is not connected to the network. I neat trick, though I'd like to see some more security reviews before I'd deploy it broadly.</p>

<p>Probably the most interesting, but least useful to me, was a booth for <a href=http://www.magiqtech.com/>Magiq Technology</a>, who offer a commercial quantum cryptography solution. Quantum cryptography is the ultimate in secret key exchange at a distance -- you can sort of say that the universe protects you from snoopers. However, you have to have a fiber-optic connection between the two devices, which limits its practicality. But it is still cool.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>As I head out next week to the <a href=http://2004.rsaconference.com/>RSA Conference</a> I realized that it has been 13 years since I attended the first one. I remember fondly the potential and power of cryptography technology in 1991 -- public keys, digital certificates, new possibilities for privacy, digital cash, etc.</p>

<p>After 8 more years I left the compujter security industry on March 15, 1999. The computer security industry also seemed to be filled with as much potential as it did back in 1991. Amazon, EBay, and other Internet notables were still riding high, and driving before them the need for secure Internet transactions. The government's attempt to cripple the industry through their Clipper chip initiative was all but dead, and we were slowly winning the rights to export our technologies without severe and unnecessary government restrictions. We were beginning to truly see how Certificate Authorities worked in practical usage, and were coming up with plans for smaller, more efficient certs, to help bring security to wireless devices and set-top boxes.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that I left the industry at such a height, but I'd accomplished my own personal goals. I helped midwife the startup of <a href=http://www.verisign.com>VeriSign</a>, and digital certificates were now broadly available for both servers and clients. I'd helped fight Clipper, and freed RSAREF so that it could be used by Open Source software before the expiration of the patent. I'd grown Consensus Development, a company I founded almost a decade before, from a small engineering house into the premiere SSL developer. I'd lead the team that developed the SSL Reference version for Netscape, and had completed the IETF's <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt>RFC 2246</a> that described the future of SSL called TLS.</p>

<p>Thus I found myself at the heart of a burgeoning Internet commerce industry. When <a href=http://www.certicom.com>Certicom</a>, a leading cryptography company, had expressed a desire to purchase my company, I considered the returns for my investors, the value to my employees -- I was pleased with the results, and agreed. So I made an exit from the security industry, and as part of my agreement with Certicom I signed a non-compete which gave them a few years' head start before I dipped my foot back into the security industry. </p>

<p>Now, five years more have gone by. My non-compete with Certicom has expired and for over a year I have slowly been easing my way back into the world of security and cryptography. I must admit, I was a bit uncertain at first. Five years ago I had seen the industry perched on the edge of the next big change. It had been prepared to secure the hundreds of new applications that were proliferating on the net; to broadly adopt TLS, the newest version of SSL; to really look at the practical applications of certificate authorities and recreate the entire concept as a second generation of ideas. I wondered how far behind I would be, if I'd recognize the industry at all. Internet time had still been moving fast back in 1999 and I wasn't sure how many generations had gone by in the security industry. One, two, more?</p>

<p>So last year I started attending security related conferences again, such as <a href=http://www.ietf.org/meetings/meetings.html>IETF Meetings</a>, the <a href=http://2004.rsaconference.com/>RSA Conference</a>, and others. I was ready to come as a student, to soak up the new knowledge imparted in the talks and tutorials, to glory in the changes that the last five years had brought. Instead I discovered, almost nothing had changed. If anything, the industry had been moving backward, just a tiny bit. </p>

<p>What had happened to an industry that just five years ago had been rapidly pushing forward the frontiers of technology? </p>

<p>And, more important, how could it move forward? </p>

<h4>The State of the Industry: Living off of Fear</h4>

<p>Overall, I find the state of the security industry to be a bit sobering for its lack of momentum in recent years. This slowdown can be seen nowhere as easily as upon the exhibit floor of RSA Conference, the premiere conference for this industry, which I attended last year and will attend again next week.</p>

<p>Walking the floors of RSA last year, in the immense exhibit hall at the San Jose Convention Center, I did feel a sense of energy. The floor was still packed, and the carefully cut kiosks and the garish banners bespoke the millions put into the show by the exhibitors. The constant chatter was a deafening white noise, and whenever I veered too near a booth, there was a salesman very eager to tell me about his company's latest and greatest. </p>

<p>But, to a certain extent, that energy felt to me like a facade. There was nothing new; instead all the exhibitors were showing off the same technology that they were displaying five years ago. There was a bit of glitz and some extra chrome, perhaps a carefully redesigned product name, but beyond that there was a weird feeling of deja vu. </p>

<p>There were the same old tools that we've been using to deter hackers since the advent of the Morris Worm way back in 1989: products to detect intruders and safeguard your machines against them; firewalls; and VPNs. Maybe we've gotten a little better at figuring out expert rules, maybe we've improved our user interfaces, but these are slow, gradual upgrades, not quantum leaps.</p>

<p>Email still seems to be the newest battlefield upon which security wars are being fought, and you could find any number of new anti-spam tools at RSA. The Bayesian filters are a new and interesting way to statistically classify spam, but at the core level they're a dynamic outgrowth of keyboard filters that have been around for as long as we've been fighting unsolicited commercial email. RSA's big release of the year, Nightingale, was simply another way to protect sensitive online information, a competitor to Microsoft's Wallet technology. We had the ubiquitous hardware tokens too, and discussion of the recently approved AES encryption standard, but nothing dramatically new and exciting. </p>

<p>I suppose I shouldn't have been too surprised, based on my experiences at IETF a month before. Most of the Security Area working groups were still working on the same problems that they'd been discussing five years before. S/MIME is pushing forward on yet another draft of a standard that has never been broadly deployed. IPSEC is similarly continuing to work on the same problems, now years old. TLS was widely implemented and specified, but not widely adopted -- the world still uses SSL 3.0.</p>

<p>In the last year since those two conferences I had lunch with various professional colleagues that I had lost track of, continued to watch as a bystander the leading edge of security and cryptography.</p>

<p>As I overview the industry I have begun to feel that we'd largely abandoned the most interesting and innovative security techniques that were being discussed just five years ago. What happened to alternative public key infrastructures? What happened to attribute or role certificates? What happened to "authorization" being the next step after "authentication", or separating "security" from "privacy"?</p>

<p>Remarkably, if any of these topics are being considered, they seem to be moving outside of the traditional security industry. Such is the case with <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security">SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language</a>, a branch of XML which seems to be doing some of the only work on attribute certificates.</p>

<p>With so many technologies abandoned utterly, or else given up to another computer fields, we must ask: why are we stagnating, moving backward rather than forward? </p>

<h4>Fear: Outlining the Problem</h4>

<p>I thought, could it be the result of the dot-bomb and subsequent recession? Perhaps that is part of it, but we are in denial unless we face the deeper cause. If we go on as we are the security industry will not recover with the next boom.</p>

<p>The decline of the security industry is based upon a basic disconnect between the business world and the security world. </p>

<p>Within the security industry we base our models of trust upon mathematics. We strive to continually push the envelope by codifying security and improving it. On the other hand the business industry bases its models of trust upon risk. It balances the risk of a bad outcome, the cost of that bad outcome, and the cost of reducing that risk. Even if a system is technically insecure, the business world will accept it if the risk of a security breach is low, the cost of a security breach is low, or the cost of closing that breach is high. </p>

<p>Where our model is mathematics, theirs is economics. These two models worked well in tandem for quite a few years; the need for a security industry was initially obvious because of the totally undefined risks and the potentially high costs that were out there, waiting to be taken advantage of.</p>

<p>But now, years later, we've done our job too well. We've taken all those undefined risks and codified them -- made them real and quantifiable. We've offered real demonstrations of online security through years of ecommerce, and in doing so we've proven lower rates of credit card fraud, and almost total proof from high-cost offline problems like extortion and bad reputation. We've helped fill out business' risk models and so shown when we were necessary and when weren't. </p>

<p>In short, we have dug ourselves into a hole. Thus it shouldn't be surprising that the newer security technologies are stagnating ... because we've carefully, cleverly, and constantly diminished our revenues by staying with a business model in which 'good enough' security will become ever cheaper. We've turned our security business into a cheaper alternative to insurance, where business only pay for security if their insurance premiums would otherwise be too high. As the bulk of the risk is now handled by old, cheap technology, what remains for new sales is not enough to keep us truly innovating.</p>

<p>Recent statistics underline the decreasing value of innovative, new security to businesses. According to the <a href="http://www.gocsi.com/press/20030528.jhtml?_requestid=105732">CSI/FBI 2003 Computer Crime and Security Survey</a>, the annual cost of computer crime has decreased in almost every category. From 2001 to 2003, the cost for theft of proprietary information is down from $151.2M to $70.2M. System penetration by outsiders is down from $19.1M to $2.8M. Insider abuse of network access is down from $35.0M to $11.8M. The only computer crime up in dollar damage inflicted is denial-of-service attacks, a very small part of the security pie. </p>

<p>With costs due to computer crime plunging year after year, clearly companies are not incentivized to put money in new prevention technologies.</p>

<p>To simplify, as long as the risks were unknown, we were in a business feeding off of 'fear' and our security industry 'pie' was growing. But as we and our customers both understand the risks better, and as we get better at mitigating those risks cheaply, this "fear" shrinks and thus the entire 'pie' of the security industry becomes smaller. Yes, new 'threats' keep on coming: denial-of-service, worms, spam, etc., but businesses understanding of past risks make them believe that these new risks can be solved and commodified in the same way.</p>

<p>As the philosophy and culture of the business world is hundreds of years old, going back to at least the Italian merchants of the Renaissance, business isn't going to change its model of how business works. Thus, it is up to us to rework the basic beliefs and understanding of our security industry.</p>

<p>In order to get out of this hole we need to dramatically rethink how we approach, develop, and market security services. To do this requires us to reconsider our own security models, based upon a better understanding of core business models. Some possibilities: </p>

<ol><li><a href=#insurance>Enter the Insurance Business</a></li>
<li><a href=#reliabiliy>Move into Reliability Improvement</a></li>
<li><a href=#enabling>Move into Enabling Technologies</a></ol>

<h4><a name=insurance>Solution #1: Entering the Insurance Business</a></h4>

<p>Entering the insurance business is an old idea. It was once an important part of <a href=http://www.verisign.com>Verisign's</a> business plan, and no doubt of others as well.</p>

<p>At its simplest level, we can enter the insurance business by offering a guarantee against damages with a product. The main benefit of this approach is that it lets us approach security in a more rational and realistic fashion. No longer do we have to engage in an endless quest for improved security, no matter how small the risk. Instead we can assess our risks and prepare ourselves to accept manageable losses. </p>

<p>There are risks implicit in this solution as well. For the most part, those of us in the security industry are unfamiliar with the insurance business model, and thus we're entering particularly uncharted waters. In addition, we need to understand that some losses will be huge and unavoidable, such as was the case with the Code Red worm. We thus need to create business models that are acceptable to our customers, but which do not leave us entirely liable for the next utterly unforeseen worm which gets set loose on the Internet. </p>

<p>There may also be some limitations with this particular model, if the valuations of security companies are too low to insure the losses of a large corporation, such as a GM. </p>

<p>Finally, we need to ask ourselves the question: "What value does insured security provide over simple insurance?" I suspect there are some real values to customers in saved productivity and time, but further market research would be required to truly assess this. </p>

<p>A security company could offset most of these risks by a partnership with an insurance company or another business within the insurance industry. We would need deep reserves and to work together with imaginative actuaries. Together we could offer insurance against the damages of security breaches. We would be the guardians against break-ins and the fixers if they did occur. The insurance company would help estimate risks, collect premiums and pay. </p>

<p>If we chose to go it alone, we could offer risk mitigation services to insurance companies. We would guard and provide disaster mitigation services for a monthly premium. For example, when offering an anti-breakin security system, we could offer a guarantee to rebuild all certified systems if an intrusion does occur. This way we would take some, but not all, of the risks. Perhaps our presence would reduce insurance premiums enough to pay for our fees. </p>

<p>Overall, despite potential risks, I believe that using an insurance model is a strong possibility for the security industry. </p>

<h4><a name=reliability>Solution #2: Improving Reliability</a></h4> 

<p>Some of us in the security business may feel like we are already providing reliability, because many of our products prevent catastrophic risks due to break-in, theft, and other malevolent acts. However, what we generally tend to offer is data security, not data reliability. Perhaps paradoxically, at the more personal, day-to-day level, the security industry has actually reduced data reliability in the name of improved data security. </p>

<p>I can personally testify to this fact because I have, recently, lost data due to security. I encrypted a directory in Windows XP, then was later forced to rebuild my system. Apparently some of the required info to decrypt the directory was stored in some unrecoverable registry entry, because I can no longer access it. The data is totally secure, but also unavailable. </p>

<p>This anecdote isn't unusual for the security industry. Forgotten keys can often cause cryptographic-related data loss. Likewise, VPNs and firewalls introduce single points of failure into networks. </p>

<p>RSA's Nightingale technology of last year is a fairly standard security-based technology. It uses "secret-splitting" technology to divide sensitive data among two different locations, thus removing what RSA calls "a single point of compromise"; you can't get access to the data unless you compromise two machines. Clearly, there is improved data security. However it raises the same old problem of data reliability, because now data can be lost if either of two servers is lost. </p>

<p>Improving reliability of extant security protocols is a good move forward in this expansion of the industry. For example in a classic cryptography situation we might unlock data with multiple secrets, but only require a set number of those secrets to unlock the data, not all of them.</p>

<p>Consider a company who is encrypting some of their most sensitive sales and marketing data. Ten company officers might each possess a secret which together can be used to decrypt all the data. However, this introduces a clear reliability problem, as the departure of any officer could leave all sales and marketing data unreadable. (Likewise, just restricting this data access to one specific secret, such as that of the VP of Sales, introduces this single-point-of-failure condition.) Instead we could offer a high reliability, but secure situation where any five (of ten) secrets together could decrypt the data. Therefore, if an individual officer disappears, leaves for a rival company, or otherwise makes his secret unavailable, not only can he himself not access the data alone, but even if he leaves with the secret the remainder of the company's access is unaffected. And, if a company didn't think that "5 of 10" executive was the right number, they could instead only require "3 of 10" to decrypt the data ... or "7" or "9".</p>

<p>By thinking in this new methodology, by measuring security against reliability, we can offer our customers real choices and let them each choose the level of security that works best for them. </p>

<p>However, the underlying bases of cryptography let us go a step further than this. Even without considering security implications, we can make use of our existing cryptographic algorithms in order to allow for more reliable access to and retrieval of all sorts of data. In other words, we can offer protection against not just hackers, but also backup errors, system crashes, and other catastrophic failures that are actually much more likely to affect the average user than an Internet security breach is. </p>

<p><a href=http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ips-charter.html>iSCSI</a>, a remote SCSI protocol, offers very good potential for interaction with cryptography. A redundancy caching technique, somewhat like RAID 5, could be integrated with a secret share system where, e.g., the data could be read as long as 80% of the remote drives (and thus their keys) could be accessed; this allows for a very high reliability storage system because individual storage drives could be distantly located, and at the same time uses cryptographic techniques to offset reliability problems that could potentially be caused by the uncertain and fluid nature of Internet connectivity. </p>

<p>Even issues like load balancing and methods to deal with machine down-time might all be improved by some of our cryptographic techniques.</p>

<h4><a name=enabling>Solution #3: Leaving Behind Fear</a></h4>

<p>In talking about insurance and reliability I feel like I'm largely expanding upon a fairly well-known and conservative way of using cryptography. These are good first steps for companies that wish to move forward in a cryptography market that is shrinking due to our own success, but they're not necessarily enough for a major breakout into revenue sources that will make this once again an exciting industry from a business point of view.</p>

<p>What is required, I believe, is a major paradigm shift. We need to leave the whole business of fear behind and instead embrace a new model: using cryptography to enable business rather than to prevent harm. We need to add value by making it possible to do profitable business in ways that are impossible today. There are, fortunately, many cryptographic opportunities, if we only consider them. </p>

<p>Cryptography can be used to make business processes faster and more efficient. With tools derived from cryptography, executives can delegate more efficiently and introduce better checks and balances. They can implement improved decision systems. Entrepreneurs can create improved auction systems. Nick Szabo is one of the few developers who has really investigated this area, through his work on <a href=http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_9/szabo/>Smart Contracts</a>. He has suggested ways to create digital bearer certificates, and has contemplated some interesting secure auctioning techniques and even digital liens. Expanding upon his possibilities we can view the ultimate Smart Contract as a sort of Smart Property. Why not form a corporation on the fly with digital stock certificates, allow it to engage in its creative work, then pay out its investors and workers and dissolve? With new security paradigms, this is all possible. </p>

<p>Federated identity is another area for potential expansion. Secure, federated identities could offer many benefits for consumers. Imagine being able to visit a third-party seller on the Internet, automatically charge a sale to your Amazon account, then automatically ship it to your standard address, all through a single secured identity token. Federated network identity also has real applicability in the business world, as is shown by the work being done by <a href=http://www.projectliberty.org/>Liberty Alliance</a>. Through a business system like this, an auto parts manufacturer could offer his products to General Motors as part of a larger bid, all without having to specifically arrange identity with GM itself. </p>

<p>However, there are notable challenges in the area of federated identity -- challenges which a new-paradigm security industry could lead the way in solving. Distinctions must be made regarding various levels of identity security, so that, e.g., your VPN couldn't be accessed if someone gained access to your Amazon password. In addition there are real concerns from users about controlling their user information, due to worries over spam and privacy; some users, for examples, might not want information about their politics, sexuality, or interests federated with information about their family or job. For instance do we really want our information on <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> to be used by <a href=http://www.google.com>Google</a>?. These challenges demonstrate why federated identity is still a leading edge possibility for the security industry.</p>

<p>Beyond business processes and federated identity there are many other areas that the security industry should be considering, as it moves beyond the business of fear. The whole idea of Public Key Infrastructures should perhaps be rethought, and maybe we should resuscitate lost technologies such as Attribute Certificates, and some of the ideas such as local name spaces as in described Rivest's <a href=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/sdsi.html>SDSI</a>. There are also some interesting possibilities for trusted peer-to-peer environments that can be dynamically expanded on the fly. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination, if we can just think beyond current possibilities.</p>

<p>We have already seen the first wave of security technology; now we need to initiate a second, for I believe with the next wave the best is yet to come.

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>While at <a href=http://etech.weblogsinc.com/>eTech</a>, I attended a number of "social software" sessions. One thing I heard was a persistent call from folk like <a href=http://blogs.it/0100198/>Marc Canter</a> for all the vendors to support something called <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a>. FOAF is a standard for "Friend of a Friend" files, and is an attempt to make <em>machine readable</em> information about people, groups, companies, and other online resources. In particular, it is focused on representing the information that you might typically put on your personal home page in a form such that meta-data tools can interpret it.</p>

<p>If you are using the blog service <a href=http://www.typepad.com>TypePad</a> or the social networking service <a href=http://www.ecademy.com>Ecademy</a> you may already have a FOAF file without knowing it, and <a href=http://www.tribe.net>Tribe.Net</a> announced at eTech that they were promising to support it as well for their social networking service.</p>

<p>FOAF as a standard is still in a fairly primitive state -- to me it feels like HTML did during the days of the early Mosaic browser, when every good web page had to be hand-crafted in a text editor and uploaded to a server. However, like HTML, it may have great promise.</p>

<p>The first thing that FOAF may offer us is a way to exchange information between various social networking services. For instance, I just exported all my <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> friends into my own FOAF file by hand, but there are those who are working on tools to do this automatically, and once Tribe offers FOAF, services like Orkut may be forced to do the same.</p>

<p>Probably more important in the long run is that FOAF may decentralize the data that you make public about yourself -- to put the data under your own control. Owned by you rather then owned by the services you use. For instance, many people have <a href=http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/35375.html>complained about Orkut's ownership of information</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with FOAF right now is that it doesn't support very much "progressive disclosure" or privacy. Progressive disclosure is how people typically handle private information -- they disclose information about themselves a bit at a time, and as trust builds, offer more. The only small measure of privacy that FOAF has is that it has a way to obscure email addresses so that they can't easily be harvested by spammers. But all your other information is totally public. Theoretically you can <a href=http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles>encrypt your FOAF</a> file, but this method requires external PGP-based encrypted files. There is also the possibility of <a href=http://www.w3.org/Signature/>XML-DSIG</a>, however, I find this standard to also be extremely cumbersome right now. <a href=http://www.plaxo.com>Plaxo</a> is a major social networking service that has some excellent <a href=http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/000007.html>comments on FOAF privacy</a> and other issues.</p>

<p>What I want is something that allows people to make 'local' assertions about themselves and their friends, and be able to have those friends be able to 'discover' more information by using those assertions. Ron Rivest came out with an interesting method for this in an old project called <a href=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sdsi10.html>SDSI - A Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure</a> that I hope will inspire a few FOAF architects someday. To adopt his method for FOAF requires everyone to have a FOAF service script somewhere and not just a data file. But we've seen broad adoption of personal RSS and Trackback services, so I don't think this is a huge obstacle to overcome.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to play around with FOAF take over control of your own public data, I've included detailed information on how to get started in hand-crafting your own FOAF file.</p>

<h4>Hand-Crafting your own FOAF</h4>

<p>First, start with <a href=http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html>FOAF-a-Matic</a>. This is a web form page that will create a very simple starting FOAF file for you. Don't put any information in it that you don't want to be public, and skip the section on "people you know". When it asks for your email address, make sure to enter it in all lower-case. When completed, it will look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
  xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"&gt;
  &lt;foaf:Person&gt;
    &lt;foaf:name&gt;Christopher Allen&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
    &lt;foaf:title&gt;Mr&lt;/foaf:title&gt;
    &lt;foaf:firstName&gt;Christopher&lt;/foaf:firstName&gt;
    &lt;foaf:surname&gt;Allen&lt;/foaf:surname&gt;
    &lt;foaf:nick&gt;Chris&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
    &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;9ee1c03552f22e89592ce583be0ab8db0c4f2c59&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
    &lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:depiction
      rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/images/ChristopherAllen(100x100).gif"/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com"/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:workInfoHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/&gt;
  &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>The next thing is to add pointers to any other FOAF files that you might have on other services, for instance, I have a profile on Marc Canter's <a href=http://peopleaggregator.com/>People Aggregator</a> service. You should also list the place where you plan on making your FOAF file available -- you might think that this is a circular reference, but it is OK. My convention is to put the most "authoritative" FOAF file last, so that if there is a conflict the last one might override earlier ones. However, in practice I've not found that any FOAF tool I've used supports this convention. Put these right above the closing <code>&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;<code> tag.</code></code></p><code><code>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=102" /&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=network&amp;amp;op=foafrdf&amp;amp;uid=42230" /&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf" /&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now upload your file to your own web site, and then run your FOAF file through two different validators, the first being the <a href=http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/>W3C RDF Validation Service</a>. It will tell you if you've made any mistakes with the RDF aspect of the file. Then use <a href=http://sw1.ilrt.org/discovery/2003/08/validation/>Rosco</a> which will also look at your schema and make recommendations as to missing items. Unfortunately, neither validator is very good at telling you what the problem is if it finds one -- again, it is like the old hand-coding HTML days when you are debugging your web pages.</p>

<p>Once you've got your basic FOAF file working, now to enter your friends. First, add to your <code>foaf:Person</code> the following:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:knows rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This is a pointer that says "look in this document for a person with the <code>rdf:nodeID</code> of MarcCanter". You can invent any value you want for this ID, mcanter, mark, canter, etc., however, it must be a unique ID on this page.</p>

<p>Then fill out the following template for each person, putting below your own <code>foaf:Person</code> but above the closing <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=""&gt;
  &lt;foaf:name&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:firstname&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:surname&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:nick&gt;&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="" /&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>So for instance with Marc Canter:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"&gt;
  &lt;foaf:name&gt;Marc Canter&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;41e872618d70ba18a7af715083f522afe7fc3238&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=4" /&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now <code>foaf:firstname</code>, <code>foaf:surname</code>, and <code>foaf:nick</code> are not absolutely essential -- you can remove them if they are not needed. I tend to only use them when there might be some confusion, for instance, for "Arthur De Boies" has "De Boise" is a surname, and "Lori Ann Miller" has "Lori Ann" as a firstname. <code>foaf:nick</code> is useful in situatations where there is a dimunitive involved, for instance "Christopher Allen" has "Chris" as a nick, and <code>foaf:nick</code> is also used by some programs online personas or for IRC chat, such as "ChristopherA".</p>

<p>Now where did the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> come from? The purpose of this number is to obscure the email address so that it can't be harvested by spammers, yet is unique enough that it can FOAF-based applications can find people. To convert an email address to a <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> you can use <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/>sha1ify</a>. Just enter the email address that you want converted in all lower case, and copy the string it generates to the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can search and see if any existing FOAF profiles exist for your friend at <a href=http://eikeon.com/foaf/>FOAF: Web View</a>, using their email address. If the friend does have a FOAF file, add it to <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> tag.</p>

<p>When you are done, test your FOAF file with the two validators, and if it works. One common problem that the validators will fail to give you a good error message about is if any of the URLs you use contain any improper characters like &amp; - in particular, Ecademy's FOAF files use this character. Just substitute &amp;amp; for every occurrence of &amp; and it should work fine. Another problem is if any of your friends have international characters in their names, for instance "Sébastien". To avoid this problem, put the following at the top of your FOAF file above your <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag.</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;

<p>Once everything is working you can submit it to services like <a href=http://eikeon.com/foaf/>FOAF: Web View</a>. You can also browse your FOAF file directly by using <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/>FOAF Explorer</a>, or import it into services like <a href=http://peopleaggregator.com>People Aggregator</a>.</p>

<p>Once your FOAF file is working and submitted, you'll want to add an "auto-discovery" meta-tag to your blog or home page. This is placed in the <code>head</code> portion of your HTML code:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml"
  title="FOAF" href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf"/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you are using TypePad, it forces you to use their FOAF file for you unless you used an Advanced Template. With an Advanced Template you can remove the following tags and replace it with the above:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;MTUserIfShow field="foaf"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="&lt;$MTUserSiteURL$&gt;foaf.rdf" /&gt;
  &lt;/MTUserIfShow&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>From this point on it is just a matter of looking at other people's FOAF files and seeing if you want to add any of the other profile properties that they use. I'm trying to keep a well documented foaf at <a href=http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf>http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf</a>, and I also recommend looking at Morten Frederiksen's FOAF at <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf>http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf</a> which supports far more profile information then my FOAF does.</p>

<p>Also useful is the IRC chat channel at irc.freenode.net #foaf -- I got a lot of useful tips and advice there.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                    <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

			<div class=entry-body>
				<p>A fascinating series of blog entries shows the promise and peril of social software and Blogs as a medium in a male-dominated technocracy:</p>

<p>In <a href=http://www.misbehaving.net/2004/02/sexist_jokes_an.html>misbehaving.net: "sexist jokes and Orkut invites"</a>, Dana Boyd writes:<blockquote>When i received this note, i simultaneously recognized the intended joke and felt the shudder of being so blatantly seen as an object.</blockquote>At <a href=http://radiofreeblogistan.com/2004/02/04/this_social_software_stuff_is_tricky.html>Radio Free Blogistan: "This social software stuff is tricky"</a> Christian Crumlish apologizes:<blockquote>In my mind, I was cracking on the phenomenon of me being linked to so many other men. I wasn't sure if this had something to do with the population of Orkut or with my own subnetwork there.<p></p>

<p>However, by using language that divided up men and women in terms of visual appeal or attractiveness, I totally slipped over the line. What might be taken as irreverant and ironic by my "real" friends, who are probably somewhat likely to give me the benefit of the doubt and have other inputs to use in order to judge my character or values, in this context managed to hurt danah's feelings: the last thing I would have wanted to do.</p>

<p>What I crossed over into was that "unwelcome gaze" issue, not unlike in one of danah's earliest posts to misbehaving in which she wrote about being invited to a coed hot-tub party by a professional colleague and finding that uncomfortable as well.</blockquote><br>
In <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/05/publicly_processing_hurt.html>Apophenia "Publically Processing Hurt</a>, Dana responds:<blockquote>Don't get me wrong: i'm not screamingly upset. Frankly, i was far more nervous and concerned about posting the damn thing than going through the situation. But i wanted to lay out the experience, the emotions for others to read and understand. Not because i had worried myself sick or magnified the situation out of proportion. It was a situation, it would pass, but maybe some good would come out of posting it for others to see. It is the raw emotions, the logic in our heads that bring us to a situation. We rarely make this visible. For those who don't understand, the goal isn't to give you fodder to attack. Instead, try understanding what life from my perspective might look like. <p></p>

<p>And then the unexpected happened. Bless his heart, the owner of said comment made a public apology. He didn't need to own up to that statement, but he did. And he went on to offer his emotional reaction to my tinge of hurt. And he continued on to defend both me, my post and my sense of humor (ah, yes, public support is the quickest way to make me respect someone). So, i'm floored. And surprised. And terribly appreciative.</blockquote>I have some understanding of Christian -- I consider myself a conscious feminist, but sometimes our male world-view sets us up for a clash. I could easily see myself in his situation, realizing that there are so few women among my connections, trying to fix that, and then falling flat on my face.<p></p>

<p>I've run into this type of thing before at <a href=http://www.skotos.net/>Skotos</a> -- one of our games <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/>Castle Marrach</a> is notable as a commercial game that has probably more women involved in it then men. This was a deliberate part of the game design, but when I talk about how and why we designed it that way it is easy for me to come across as sexist.</p>

<p>Also, the context is important. If this 'joke' had been spoken and in a semi-private medium where everyone knows and trusts each other, it would have come across very differently. Instead, it was sent to a circle of friends where everyone knew Christian, but not everyone knew each other. This is more proof that even 'friends of friends' can be a pretty distant connection. If the joke had been told at <a href=http://www.livejournal.com>Live Journal</a>, which is also dominated by women (64%), it also would have come across differently.</p>

<p>I'm even uncomfortable writing this blog entry, because no matter what I do, there is no way I can precisely understand what it is like to be in Dana's place, or any women's place for that matter. All I can do is empathize with Dana discomfort and try to not make such mistakes myself.<br>
