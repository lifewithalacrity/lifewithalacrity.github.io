                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d15461c9970c-pi style="display: inline;" class=asset-img-link><img border=0 src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d15461c9970c-800wi alt="Christopher Allen Internet Security Pioneer Speaking at Consensus 10 Sep NYC" title="Christopher Allen Internet Security Pioneer Speaking at Consensus 10 Sep NYC" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d15461c9970c image-full img-responsive"></a></p>
<p>I'm heading out today to New York City to speak at <a href=http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/>Consensus 2015</a>, where I am speaking on the panel <em>‘Bitcoin and its Antecedents: A Look at the History and Evolution of Digital Cash’</em>:</p>
<blockquote>Bitcoin is far from the first attempt at creating a form of digital money with the potential to upend existing systems. Our panelists will look at bitcoin's predecessors and close cousins. Nathaniel Popper wrote the book Digital Gold, which delves into bitcoin's genesis; Christopher Allen is an internet security expert who has been involved in digital cash systems including Digicash for decades, while Garrick Hileman is CoinDesk's lead analyst and an economic historian at the LSE, specializing in alternative and private monies.</blockquote>
<p>This invite probably came about from an extended interview that Tim Swanson, author of the blockchain book and blog <a href=http://www.ofnumbers.com>The Great Wall of Numbers</a>, shared with his readers. Tim wrote me saying <em>“There is some dispute, apparently, of the history and precursors of distributed computing / consensus before Bitcoin<em>”</em></em>, and and asked me if I would share my <em>“own view of what a blockchain is defined as, what Nakamoto consensus is relative to other 'solutions' to Byzantine faults, triple entry accounting, etc.”</em> He published my answers in his post <a href=http://www.ofnumbers.com/2015/07/09/a-blockchain-with-emphasis-on-the-a/>A blockchain with emphasis on the ‘a’</a>. For posterity, I thought I'd also share my part of the interview here:</p>
<p>I certainly was an early digital currency banner waiver — I did some consulting work with Xanadu, and later for the very early Digicash. At various points in the growth of SSL both First Virtual and PGP tried to acquire my company. When I saw Nick’s “<a href=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548/469>First Monday</a>” article the day it came out, as it immediately clicked a number of different puzzle pieces that I’d not quite put together into one place. I immediately started using the term smart contracts and was telling my investors, and later Certicom, that this is what we really should be doing (maybe because I was getting tired of battles in SSL/TLS standards when that wasn’t what Consensus Development had been really founded to solve).</p>
<p>However, in the end, I don’t think any thing I did actually went anywhere, either technically or as a business, other than maybe getting some other technologists interested. So in the end I’m more of a witness to the birth of these technologies than a creator.</p>
<p>History in this area is distorted by software patents—there are a number of innovative approaches that would be scrapped because of awareness of litigious patent holders. I distinctly remember when I first heard about some innovative hash chain ideas that a number of us wanted to use hash trees with it, but we couldn’t figure out how to avoid the 1979 Merkle Hash Tree patent whose base patent wouldn’t expire until ’96, as well as some other subsidiary hash tree and time stamp patents that wouldn’t expire until early 2000s.</p>
<p>As I recall, at the time were we all trying to inspired solve the micropayment problem. Digicash had used cryptography for larger-sized cash transactions, whereas First Virtual, Cybercash and others were focused on securing the ledger side and needed larger transaction fees and thus larger amounts of money to function. To scale down we were all looking at hash chain ideas from Lamport’s S/KEY from the late 80’s and distributed transactional ledgers from X/Open’s DTP from the early 90s as inspirations. DEC introduced Millicent during this period, and I distinctly remember people saying “this will not work, it requires consumers to hold keys in a electronic wallet”. On the cryptographic hash side of this problem Adam Back did Hashcash, Rivest and his crew introduced PayWord and Micromint. On the transaction side CMU introduced <a href=http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/documents/netbill.pdf>NetBill</a>.</p>
<p>Nick Szabo wrote using hashes for post-unforgeable transaction logs in his original <a href=http://szabo.best.vwh.net/formalize.html>smart contract paper</a> in ’97, in which he referred to <a href="Surety’s work">Surety’s work</a> (and they held the Merkle hash tree and other time signature patents), but in that original paper he did not look at Proof-of-Work at all. It was another year before he, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney started talking about using proof-of-work as a possible foundational element for smart contracts. I remember some discussions over beer in Palo Alto circa ’99 with Nick after I became CTO of Certicom about creating dedicated proof-of-work secure hardware that would create tokens that could be used as an underlying basis for his smart contract ideas. This was interesting to Certicom as we had very good connections into cryptographic hardware industry, and I recommended that we should hire him. Nick eventually joined Certicom, but by that point they had cancelled my advanced cryptography group to raise profits in order to go public in the US (causing me to resign), and then later ceased all work in that area when the markets fell in 2001.</p>
<p>I truly believe that would could have had cryptographic smart contracts by ’04 if Certicom had not focused on short-profits (see Solution #3 at bottom of <a href=../2004/02/security_crypto.html>this post</a> for my thoughts back in 2004 after a 3-year non-compete and NDA)…</p>
<blockquote>What is required, I believe, is a major paradigm shift. We need to leave the whole business of fear behind and instead embrace a new model: using cryptography to enable business rather than to prevent harm. We need to add value by making it possible to do profitable business in ways that are impossible today. There are, fortunately, many cryptographic opportunities, if we only consider them. Cryptography can be used to make business processes faster and more efficient. With tools derived from cryptography, executives can delegate more efficiently and introduce better checks and balances. They can implement improved decision systems. Entrepreneurs can create improved auction systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nick Szabo is one of the few developers who has really investigated this area, through his work on Smart Contracts. He has suggested ways to create digital bearer certificates, and has contemplated some interesting secure auctioning techniques and even digital liens. Expanding upon his possibilities we can view the ultimate Smart Contract as a sort of Smart Property. Why not form a corporation on the fly with digital stock certificates, allow it to engage in its creative work, then pay out its investors and workers and dissolve? With new security paradigms, this is all possible.</blockquote>
<p>When I first heard about Bitcoin, I saw it as having clearly two different parts. First was a mix of old ideas about unforgeable transaction logs using hash trees combined into blocks connected by hash chains. This clearly is the “blockchain”. But in order for this blockchain to function, it needed timestamping, for which fortunately all the patents had expired. The second essential part of Bitcoin was through a proof-of-work system to timestamp the blocks, which clearly was based on Back’s HashCash rather than the way transactions were timestamped in Szabo’s BitGold implementation.</p>
<p>I have to admit, when I first saw it I didn’t really see much in Bitcoin that was innovative — but did appreciate how it combined a number of older ideas into one place. I did not predict its success, but thought it was an interesting experiment and that might lead to a more elegant solution. (BTW, IMHO Bitcoin became successful more because of how it leveraged cypherpunk memes and their incentives to participate in order to bootstrap the ecosystem rather than because of any particularly elegant or orginal cryptographic ideas).</p>
<p>In my head, Bitcoin consists of blocks of cryptographic transactional ledgers chained together, plus one particular approach to time-stamping this block chain that uses proof-of-work method of consensus. I’ve always thought of blockchain and mining as separate innovations.</p>
<p>To support this separation for your article, I have one more <a href=http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html>quote</a> to offer you from Nick Szabo:</p>
<blockquote>Instead of my automated market to account for the fact that the difficulty of puzzles can often radically change based on hardware improvements and cryptographic breakthroughs (i.e. discovering algorithms that can solve proofs-of-work faster), and the unpredictability of demand, Nakamoto designed a Byzantine-agreed algorithm adjusting the difficulty of puzzles. I can’t decide whether this aspect of Bitcoin is more feature or more bug, but it does make it simpler.</blockquote>
<p>As to your question of when the community first started using the word consensus, I am not sure. The cryptographic company I founded in 1988 that eventually created the reference implementation of SSL 3.0 and offered the first TLS 1.0 toolkits was named “Consensus Development” so my memory is distorted. To me, the essential problem has always been how to solve consensus. I may have first read it about it in “The Ecology of Computation” published in 1988 which predicted many distributed computational approaches that are only becoming possible today, which mentions among other things such concepts as Distributed Scheduling Protocols, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance, Computational Auctions, etc. But I also heard it from various science fiction books of the period, so that is why I named my company after it.</p>

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-pi style="float: right;" class=asset-img-link><img src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-250wi alt="Resource Sharing" title="Resource Sharing" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b img-responsive" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>In 2009, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom title="Wikipedia Page on Elinor Ostrom" target=_self>Elinor Ostrom</a> received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her <em>“analysis of economic governance, especially <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons title="Wikipedia Page on The Commons" target=_self>the commons</a>”</em>.</p>
<p>Since then I've seen a number of different versions of her list of the 8 principles for effectively managing against <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons title="Wikipedia Page for The Tragedy of the Commons" target=_self>the tragedy of the commons</a>. However, I've found her original words — as well as many adaptions I've seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.</p>
<p>This last weekend, at two very different events — one on the <a href=http://www.futureofworking.org title="Future of Working Summit" target=_self>future of working</a> and the other on the <a href="http://crypto.sabir.cc/?page_id=237" target=_self>future of the block chain</a> (used by technologies like bitcoin) — I wanted to share these principles. However, I was unable to effectively articulate them.</p>
<p>So I decided to take an afternoon to re-read the original, as well as more contemporary adaptions, to see if I could summarize this into a list of effective design principles. I also wanted to generalize them for broader use as I often apply them to everything from how to manage an online community to how a business should function with competitors.</p>
<p>I ended up with 10 principles, each beginning with a verb-oriented commandment, followed by the design principle itself.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DEFINE BOUNDARIES:</strong> There are clearly defined boundaries around the common resources of a system from the larger environment.</li>
<li><strong>DEFINE LEGITIMATE USERS:</strong> There is a clearly defined community of legitimate users of those resources.</li>
<li><strong>ADAPT LOCALLY:</strong> Rules for use of resources are adapted to local needs and conditions.</li>
<li><strong>DECIDE INCLUSIVELY:</strong> Those using resources are included in decision making.</li>
<li><strong>MONITOR EFFECTIVELY:</strong> There exists effective monitoring of the system by accountable monitors.</li>
<li><strong>SHARE KNOWLEDGE:</strong> All parties share knowledge of local conditions of the system.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD ACCOUNTABLE:</strong> Have graduated sanctions for those who violate community rules.</li>
<li><strong>OFFER MEDIATION:</strong> Offer cheap and easy access to confict resolution.</li>
<li><strong>GOVERN LOCALLY:</strong> Community self-determination is recognized by higher-level authorities.</li>
<li><strong>DON'T EXTERNALIZE COSTS:</strong> Resource systems embedded in other resource systems are organized in and accountable to multiple layers of nested communities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I welcome your thoughts on ways to improve on this summarized list. In particular, in #10 I'd like to find a better way to express its complexity (the original is even more obtuse).</p>

                                <p>Between the business of the March/April conference season and leaving Blackphone, I've run out of business cards. Rather than rush to print a bunch of new ones, I'm created this mini-resume for digital sharing and a two-sided Avery business card version that I am printing on my laser printer and sharing.</p>
<p>Not as pretty as my old Life With Alacrity cards, but effective in getting across the diversity of my professional experience and interests.</p>
<p><a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d0f2961e970c-pi style="display: inline; border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; border-color: black;" class=asset-img-link><img border=0 src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d0f2961e970c-800wi alt="Christopher Allen Micro Resume" title="Christopher Allen Micro Resume" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d0f2961e970c image-full img-responsive"></a></p>
<p>As someone who teaches Personal Branding in my courses at BGI@Pinchot.edu, I always find it hard to practice as I preach to ask for advice and suggestions. In this case I'm trying to tame my three-headed Cerebus of a profession with Privacy/Crypto/Developer Community, an Innovative Business Educator/Instructional Designer head, and my Collaborative Tools, Processes, Games and Play head. All come tied together in my body as ultimately being about collaboration, but it is hard to explain some of the correspondences.</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p class=p1><span class=s1> <a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c-pi style="float: right;" class=asset-img-link><img src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c-320wi alt="Opening Scene of Darmok, STtNG S05E02" title="Opening Scene of Darmok, STtNG S05E02" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e21095970c img-responsive" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>If you consider yourself a futurist or an agent of change, you should read this article from The Atlantic <a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/>"Shaka, When the Walls Fall"</a>. Yes, it uses a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok>Star Trek episode</a> as an allegory, it is a bit confusing and has a lot of complexity and depth, but it is a good introduction to a topic I care about — <em><strong>Deep Context Shared Languages</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>I consider one of my missions in life to be to "create tools that allow people to communicate about complexity". There are many problems to address and many possible solutions to those problems. My <span class=s2><a href=https://www.facebook.com/InfiniteCanvasSuite/>Infinite Canvas Suite</a> </span>app tries to address problems of linearity. Another way to manage complexity is facilitating the creation and learning of <a href=../2009/09/creating-shared-language-and-shared-artiifacts.html>Shared Languages</a>.</span></p>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>Some of what Shared Language is is tribal — it has an elemental power to help a group form. But what a shared language also does is allow a group to take shortcuts. For instance, with the <a href=https://www.facebook.com/GroupWorksDeck/><span class=s2>Group Works Deck</span></a> Pattern Language, I can say the phrase "Viewpoint Shift" and practitioners know that I mean <em>"Step from your usual perspective into another in order to better understand someone, shift energy, reframe meanings, open up new ideas, or simply see a situation with new eyes."</em> But they also know more than that — they can connect that concept to their own experience of doing this practice.</span></p>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>The first time I was introduced to this concept was by expert facilitator and futurist <a href=https://www.facebook.com/RMattTaylor><span class=s2>Matt Taylor</span></a>, who has in his communities a Shared Language concept called a "Glass Bead Game", which is from a story by Herman Hess. As <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game>Wikipedia cites it</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>"The Glass Bead Game is "a kind of synthesis of human learning" in which themes, such as a musical phrase or a philosophical thought, are stated. As the Game progresses, associations between the themes become deeper and more varied."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=p1><span class=s1> <a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-pi style="float: right;" class=asset-img-link><img src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-75wi alt="Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design" title="Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c img-responsive" style="width: 60px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>When you know the shared language of Matt's community, you can express concisely "In the SOLUTION BOX I am at INSIGHT, PHILOSOPHY and SCHEMATIC DESIGN." Which means, in other words, <em>"I have a mature idea that I feel is a synthesis of all the challenges inherent in the project, I can talk about it with some clarity and express it as a visual solution. I have done a lot of work yet I do not have a buildable design."</em> Someone familiar with the language can then respond in kind, rather than coming from a different perspective in the solution box and think that I have built something that is ready for production.</span></p>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>Sometimes hash tags are a more contemporary expression that there may exist a Deep Context. For instance, just saying <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/glassbeadgame?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class=s3>#‎</span><span class=s4>GlassBeadGame</span></a> is a challenge for someone to respond in kind with a model of their own. Hash tags like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/intrapreneuring?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class=s3>#‎</span><span class=s4>Intrapreneuring</span></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freedomtofail?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class=s3>#‎</span><span class=s4>FreedomToFail</span></a> also have Deep Contexts with different communities. If someone says to me <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cynefin?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class=s3>#‎</span><span class=s4>Cynefin</span></a> I know that we share an understanding with me about the difference between <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework>"complicated" vs "complex" </a>and how to work with each.</span></p>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>So what makes for great deep context shared languages? I don't know, but this article touches on it. It is more than just metaphor, more than allegory, more than meme. But if we can figure out how to create and teach it, it may be a powerful tool for communicating about complexity.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>KEYQUOTE: "Here we might distinguish between the invocation of a particular logic and the simulation of a creature, thing, or idea by replicating its image. The simulation of life in art often concerns the reproduction of surfaces: in painting, the appearance of form, perspective, or the rendition of light; in literature the appearance of character or event; in photography and cinema the rendition of the world as it appears through optical element and upon emulsion or sensor; in theater the rendition of the behavior of a character or situation.</span></p>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>While all these examples “simulate” to various extents, they do so by a process of rendering. For example, the writer might simulate a convincing verbal intercourse by producing a credibility that allows the reader to take it as reality. Likewise, the actor might render a visible behavior or intonation that is suggestive of a particular emotion, event, or history that the theatrical or cinematic viewer takes as evidence for some unseen motivation.</span></p>
<p class=p1><span class=s1>A logic is also a behavior, but it is a behavior unlike the behavior of the literary or theatrical character, for whom behaving involves producing an outward sign of some deeper but abstracted motivation, understanding, or desire. By contrast logics are pure behaviors. They are abstract and intangible and yet also real.</span></p>
<p class=p2><span class=s1>If we pretend that “Shaka, when the walls fell” is a signifier, then its signified not by the fictional mythological character Shaka, nor the myth that contains whatever calamity caused the walls to fall, but the logic by which the situation itself came about. Tamarian language isn’t really language at all, but machinery."</span></p>

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><em>(by Christopher Allen with Elyn Andersson and Shannon Appelcline)</em></p>
<p><a href=http://www.BGI.edu style="float: right;"><img src=http://www.bgi.edu/files/BGI-Logomark-CMYK.jpg alt="BGIedu Logo" height=100 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" border=0 width=100></a>Two years ago, the Bainbridge Graduate Institute (<a href=http://www.BGI.edu title="Bainbridge Graduate Institute" target=_self>www.BGI.edu</a>) faculty gathered to radically reinvent their sustainable business curriculum for the next decade. Our goal was not only to update course content, but also to significantly update how the material was taught. We wished to make our teaching process (our pedagogy) more interactive and also more effective for students graduating into a 21st-century work environment, where people increasingly work in teams-both online and offline.</p>
<p>As a specialist in group interactions, I was asked by the faculty whether formal graduate student study groups (called "Study Buddies") should consist of two people or of three. I did not have an easy answer to this question.</p>
<p>My expertise with group dynamics comes from professional experience as an entrepreneur and from considerable experience both building online communities and helping others to do the same. Through these processes, I've seen how groups of people act differently at different sizes. As I discussed in my previous blog post on Group Thresholds [<a href=#Allen>Allen</a>], there are pros and cons associated with different group sizes. However, the smallest group that I spoke of in that article was the 'working team size', which is a group of four to nine members (but ideally about seven). I didn't talk about groups consisting of less than four members-specifically dyads (a group of two people) and triads (a group of three people)-and that was what the BGIedu faculty was now interested in learning more about.</p>
<p>My first inclination when considering BGIedu's request was to say that triads would be the best size for study groups, but I wasn't sure. I knew from my past research on group size that a dyad has a significantly different behavior than any other small groups. However, I wasn't certain if triads should also be considered on their own, or if they were just the low end of one of those 'work teams', which I'd always thought of as containing four to nine members. Triads were a hole in my research.</p>
<p>I decided to dig deeper into this question by engaging my teaching assistant Elyn Andersson and my writing partner Shannon Appelcline to help me investigate further. This post is the fruit of our research and our discussions about dyads and triads. We hope it might help you decide whether a dyad or a triad is the better team size for groups that you are working in.</p>
<h1><a id=choosing name=choosing></a>Choosing between Dyads and Triads</h1>
<p>
<a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-pi style="float: right;" class=asset-img-link><img src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-800wi alt="Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b" border=0 title="Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain"></a>Before I share with you the details of our investigation, I want to be clear that dyads, triads, and small 'working team' groups can all be effective. Any challenge faced by groups of these sizes can be overcome by a good process, teamwork, training, or just positive energy. However, my thesis is that certain sizes of groups are better for certain purposes-and when a group size is selected appropriately it will require less energy and thus be more likely to be productive when the inevitable group challenges occur. When choosing among a dyad, a triad, or a working team, the important thing to focus on is thus the intent in forming the group.</p>
<p>For the groups being considered by BGIedu, the faculty felt that the students taking the new curriculum needed three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More formal support for studying (i.e. not ad hoc study teams);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inclusion of emotional support in that support structure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system where the members of a study group would help each other to keep their commitments to study.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last requirement - that members of these study teams would be accountable to each other without one student just taking up the slack of another - was the toughest one.</p>
<p>Clearly, working teams of 4-9 people were too large for our purposes. Teams this size are rarely intimate enough to support the needs of individuals. In addition, research shows that they are poor at supporting accountability. That's because working teams of 4-9 are very vulnerable to social loafing (i.e., slackers)-except when the tasks assigned to these working teams are highly independent (i.e. an entrepreneurial team that has different members focused on different topics, such as management, development, operations, marketing and sales) or when they require high diversity. An upcoming blog will cover this topic in more depth.</p>
<p>
<a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-pi style="float: right;" class=asset-img-link><img src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-800wi alt="Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b" border=0 title="Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain"></a>Removing working teams left the question of dyad vs. triad - which our research would show were both very different from working teams. Triads ultimately fit BGIedu's particular need better. That was primarily due to advantages of accountability and cohesion, combined with some emotional support. However, some simple numerical properties of triads also prove useful: they have elemental diversity because they're up to 50% more diverse than dyads; and if someone misses a team meeting the other two-thirds of the team can still benefit. For all of these reasons, my recommendation to the BGIedu faculty was that these formal study teams be formed in triads.</p>
<p>Dyads, however, are quite appropriate for a variety of other purposes, and should not be dismissed. I'll be talking of some of their advantages before proceeding on to the lessons learned about triads themselves.</p>

<p>Everyone has had experience with dyads. The first social experience of anyone's life is a dyadic relationship - that between a mother and her unborn child. This parent-child relationship continues once the child is born. Overall, dyads are the most common social group; they are seen everywhere, in personal, academic and business relationships.</p>
<p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/94611163@N00/683866337/ style="float: right;"><img border=0 src=http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1108/683866337_4dd654b650_n.jpg alt="Great Guitar Duo — Photo by Tom706 CC-BY-NC-ND" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>To decide if a dyad is the best group size for your needs, it is again important to focus on the purpose of the group. A number of interesting characteristics of dyads - some benefits and some limitations - make them unique from triads and other larger group sizes, among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Emotional Support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasoned Agreement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power Inequality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group Accountability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id=emotional_support name=emotional_support></a>Emotional Support</h2>
<p>There have been some academic studies [<a href=#Taylor>Taylor</a>] that suggest that it's easier to be open and share within dyads. The research has shown that people feel safer about revealing personal and intimate information in a dyad than they do when a third person is added to the group. As a result, disclosure rates increase when people are put into dyads as compared to triads. Furthermore, adding a third person to a group causes its members to be more socially conscious, making it harder for members to listen to the conversation and at the same time be aware of their own thoughts.</p>
<p>Together it's this trust level (allowing for disclosure) and this focus level (allowing for better listening) that make dyads much stronger for emotional support than triads or larger teams. If the intent of a group is to have an intimate and fully open space, or if the work of the group is emotional in nature, this might make dyads a better choice.</p>
<p>Though dyads are clearly more effective for providing emotional support, triads can still offer that as well under the right conditions.</p>
<h2><a id=commitment name=commitment></a>Commitment</h2>
<p>This intimacy and confidentiality of a dyad helps its members to build strong team dynamics relatively quickly. The two individuals not only will have formed a trust bond more easily than three or more individuals could, but they generally will have a better ratio of time to performance outcomes compared to groups of larger sizes, in part because less time is spent maintaining the team relationship itself.</p>
<p>In a triad or larger group, the group would need to put effort towards team work over task work and thus less time is put towards performing the task. In other words, more resources would be spent on relating to a teammate than on finishing a project.</p>
<h2><a id=reasoned_agreement name=reasoned_agreement></a>Reasoned Agreement</h2>
<p>The most unique element of dyads is that they are the only group size in which one voice is paired against another voice equally.</p>
<p>When was the last time you were in dyad in which you did not agree on an issue? Most likely, you and the other individual spent some considerable time trying to convince the other of your reasons, and the outcome was one of two things: you either both stuck with your opinion and walked away, or one of you changed your mind after hearing the other's ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>Because members can't 'vote', a dyad is either in agreement or disagreement, which forces a longer deliberation for tasks when consensus is required. There are times when you want a small group to deliberate deeply, and dyads are ideal for this.</p>
<h2><a id=power_inequality name=power_inequality></a>Power Inequality</h2>
<p>Though dyads have several advantages, they can also bring with them a few additional problems - one of which is a power inequality of knowledge that would be detrimental within some teams. For some tasks, this could offset the benefits of having a more intimate small group. For my BGIedu groups, I was concerned that it might prevent some students from benefiting academically from the study exercise.</p>
<p>This topic has been addressed in a study <a href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604000972>[</a><a href=#Day title=Day target=_self>Day</a>] that compared homogeneous teams that were entirely high-ability or low-ability to heterogeneous dyads of mixed abilities. The study found that while high-ability people tested better individually after learning the material in a dyad with another high-ability team mate, low-ability people did not gain much benefit from studying in a dyad with a high-ability team member.</p>
<p>This was somewhat surprising. A student with more knowledge of a subject should be able to mentor a student with less knowledge, therefore creating a true dyad study partner. However, this study showed that this was not the case.</p>
<p>The study also argued against another common conception. One might assume that two high-ability team members could learn more together, when they could bounce ideas off of each other, than they could alone. However, this was again not the case: high-ability individuals performed better after learning alone than after learning with another high-ability team member! Only homogeneous low-ability teammates performed better after being in a dyad than alone.</p>
<p>This study pushed me toward triads for study teams at BGIedu, as dyads would not be large enough to guarantee high performance outcomes; the teams would always consist of one higher performing student and one lower performing student.</p>
<h2><a id=group_accountability name=group_accountability></a>Group Accountability</h2>
<p>Another disadvantage of dyads shows up in the area of accountability. The simplest version of this issue can be shown in this question: if one teammate says she did the majority of the work, while the other teammate says the work was shared 50/50, who was correct? A tougher question: if they both say that the work was shared 50/50, how is a third party able to determine if this actually was true?</p>
<p>Elyn, my teaching assistant, interned in a high school in Seattle while working towards her Master's in Teaching. Her experiences highlight this problem. In today's educational model, collaborative learning is highly valued, and Elyn worked to incorporate in-class group work into many of her lessons. When assessing the students' group projects, however, she found that it was difficult to determine if the students shared the work equitably or if some of the students rode on the hard work of their partners. In some cases, Elyn doubted that the work was split equally. In particular, she found that if she let the students choose their own partners, the students were more likely to say that 'both' did the work, rather than tell the teacher their friend slacked off on the assignment.</p>
<p>A recent study [<a href=#Alkaslassy target=_self>Alkaslassy</a>] supports Elyn's experience. In it, students working on a paired group assignment were asked to allocate the percent of work done between the pair. 86% of the students assigned equal credit between the two individuals in the group. At a surface level, one could presume that each party performed half the work and was honest in their assignment of credit. However, Elyn and I believe that in some dyadic relationships, friendship can become an overriding factor and that in those situations, students are more likely to allocate equal credit because of this friendship, not because of true equity.</p>
<p>In the psychological field, this relates to a well-known cognitive bias called the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_bias title="Wikipedia: Egocentric Bias" target=_self>egocentric bias</a>, where an individual will claim more responsibility for group action then an independent observer would credit them. Although this is most often discussed for larger groups, in dyads a member might rate their own efforts as being half of the effort when in fact is it is less. Thus in academic group projects, it can sometimes be more effective to have the students rate their peer rather than themselves.</p>
<p>Though group accountability can be a disadvantage for dyads, it improves when you have triads, thanks in part to a triad's inability to devolve. This, as it turns out, would be another comparative advantage that helped me choose triads over dyads for BGIedu.</p>
<h1><a id=triads name=triads></a>Triads</h1>
<p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/yaketyyakyak/5991422366/in/photostream/ style="float: right;"><img border=0 src=http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6123/5991422366_6301a83c43_n.jpg alt="Fernando's Kitchen, Cambridge 30-07-11 — Photo by Dave Catchpole CC-BY" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>There are a number of interesting characteristics of triads that make them different from dyads and also from small 'working team' groups. I'll talk about three of them in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inability to Devolve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elemental Diversity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id=inability_to_devolve name=inability_to_devolve></a>Inability to Devolve</h2>
<p>We all have experienced what happens when a party gets too busy or too noisy - the size of the conversation groups get smaller. If you are having an informal dinner for seven, sometimes the conversation will include the entire table. However while people are eating the conversation will typically devolve into smaller groups: four people at one end of the table will being having one conversation, while the remaining three will be talking at the end other. Sometimes one person will be left out of any conversation, but studies show that with small groups this is less likely to happen. We have a natural tendency not to want to exclude or reject individuals unjustly, so such a singleton will usually find a place in one conversation or another.</p>
<p>Working teams also have this natural tendency to devolve when confronted with external challenges (of which noise is one of the simpler ones) or internal challenges (such as differences of opinion), only reuniting when those challenges are resolved. A team of six can devolve gracefully a number of different ways: a three and a three; a four and a two; or three groups of two. Teams of five can devolve into teams of two and three. A team of four can devolve into two teams of two. In all of these cases the devolution does not exclude any individual's voice.</p>
<p>However, a triad can not devolve without excluding someone. Triads thus have a lot of subtle pressure to try to keep the group together, so that no individual is explicitly rejected - except for a good reason. This leads to more accountability for the individuals in the group, compared to teams of two where the dyadic nature of the group can override liability.</p>
<h2><a id=voting name=voting></a>Unconscious Voting</h2>
<p>A dyad's inability to vote was an advantage of that group size, and thus issues that require deeper deliberation are often better with dyads. However, you sometimes don't want as much deliberation. You want fast action.</p>
<p>I find that we unconsciously gauge each others' opinions in a small group very quickly, and even more so with a triad. This means that a triad seems to be able to come to at least some decision very fast. There are many cases where this can be very useful - if that is the intent of your team.</p>
<p>As an personal example, I saw a presentation in the early 1990s from the Apple Human Interface Group (HIG) about their survey of how users colored "folders" on the Macintosh. The result was that there was little commonality - everyone colored folders differently for different reasons. Afterward, I met with the team and suggested that that if they instead asked teams of three to decide how to color code folders that they used together, then the results from all the different teams would have much more commonality. This suggestion ended up getting me a consulting job with Apple HIG, and shows how a triad can quickly create successful performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Triads are not the only group size that can vote easily - all odd size groups can - but I believe the voting of a triad to be fundamentally different because the voting can be so unconscious and informal that the members are not even aware of it. This can be useful, but it can also cause problems.</p>
<p>When I was just starting my business, I was doing a lot of work with a company formed by two partners who had a 50/50 stock split in their company. Theirs was a good partnership; they had very different but complementary skills and worked well and profitably together. As a fellow entrepreneur, I was a peer to both them, and we were developing a new product line together.</p>
<p>However, when I worked with them on this product line, I saw that I'd changed their very successful dyad to a triad, and I thus became a tiebreaker in many of their business decisions - including business decisions on issues that had nothing to do with our joint product. This was caused by a shift in power: one partner might ask me a question about marketing rather than asking his partner (who knew marketing), and then it would become our opinion against the remaining partner's. Conversely, I found the marketing partner asking me to side with him on development questions.</p>
<p>I found this quite troubling; a more manipulative person could have controlled or broken that relationship by always breaking the ties in their own favor. In our case, we never shipped the product line and went our separate ways. I couldn't help but think it might have been because my unofficial "vote" was causing problems in their partnership.</p>
<p>When getting a result is the purpose of a team, a triad is better than a dyad as it allows for this voting to take place. As I mentioned to BGIedu, a triad can have a two-to-one vote, allowing a better chance at task accomplishment. Task accomplishment is also achieved because triads stay on topic better than dyads due of this voting ratio: if one member of a dyad decides to go off topic, it is easy for the other to follow his or her lead. In a a triad, two out of the three members would need to 'agree' to follow an unrelated discussion.</p>
<h2><a id=elemental_diversity name=elemental_diversity></a>Elemental Diversity</h2>
<p>One final advantage of triads when compared to dyads is that the knowledge base of the group is larger. I saw this issue clearly in my recent Social Web for Social Change class at BGIedu, where I changed the team size from two to three, and immediately saw a growth in elemental diversity that benefited the groups.</p>
<p>In this class, I have the students participate in an exercise on personal branding. I originally had the students pair up in teams of two, effectively giving each student a 'branding buddy' to help them form their personal brand and to give and receive feedback. In the last year, however, I decided to change this dyad to a triad.</p>
<p>At first, these groups followed the same methods I used for dyads: one person would self-brand themselves to a second person in the group, who would then echo back what they thought they heard the first person say, using their own words. However, it is difficult for two people to really hear the similarities and differences between what they said and what they heard. The third person thus became a neutral sounding board who told both individuals that spoke what they said. Together, all three could figure out the similarities and differences between the statements. After consensus is reached, all three students switch roles. I call this the Echo Exercise, and it shows how triads can be beneficial at times when the natural characteristics of dyads don't lead to optimum results.</p>
<h1><a id=finalnotes name=finalnotes></a>Final Notes</h1>
<p><a href=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg style="float: right;"><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg alt="Tripal Spiral — from Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain" height=150 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" border=0 width=160></a>As it happens, this article was created by a triad. It wasn't purposeful, nor was it meant to show off the findings of this article. Instead, the triad evolved naturally because it proved the best group size for writing this piece.</p>
<p>I came up with the initial concept for the article and wrote out the problem and introduction. Elyn then did considerable research and wrote up a rough draft of her findings. To that point, we were a committed dyad, working together in an organic way. However, we also had an article that felt like it was in two parts. That's when I had Shannon join us. He reorganized the article, unified its voice, and produced a final draft.</p>
<p>Though it wasn't purposeful, you can see the advantages of triads just from this example. Most notably, our triad made great use of elemental diversity. Though I held the core ideas and concepts for the article, Elyn provided the research expertise and Shannon provided the editorial expertise that were required to complete it. Voting also came into the equation (in the unconscious way that it tends to in triads) when Shannon effectively "broke the tie" of two different writing styles.</p>
<p>Since then, this triad has fallen apart. It's something that was created for a specific project and with all of our other tasks, we didn't have room for it going forward. Teams breaking apart is natural. Sometimes it happens under normal conditions (as was the case with this triad), and sometimes it happens as a result of unhealthy conditions.</p>
<p>I did not give BGIedu any advice at the time about the termination of a team, although it will eventually come up: some teams will end badly, and members of these groups may leave with an impression that a triad is a bad group size, even though the size did not lead the group to ending in an unhealthy way. Perhaps the groups should be counseled, or perhaps the members should jump right back on the triad horse ... but that's a topic for another article.</p>
<p>From here, I'd like to open the conversation up to you. Have you had experiences in either dyads or triads that you would like to share? Were you one of the BGIedu students in a Study Buddy triad? Did the experiences match the studies shown here or did you have an experience that differed? We invite your comments.</p>

                                <p>One of the common practices in the independent movie industry is to share favors to keep production costs low. I loan you use of a camera and you later do some editing for me on the cheap. Of course, it is often actually less direct then that: I loan you the camera, the community knows that I am generous, and when I need some editing time on the cheap, my social capital in the film community makes the resource available to me.</p>

<p>The real value of participating in this exchange is in the reciprocity and the social capital, but if the indie project is financially successful some ill will can arise about who really owes whom. One way that some creative producers deal with this is to have in effect two budgets, the real budget, and the virtual budget. Joss Whedon (creator and producer of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, <em>Serenity</em>, <em>Firefly</em>, <em>Dollhouse</em>, etc.) describes how he did this for his recent successful internet project <a href=http://www.drhorrible.com/><em>Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</em></a> in a recent <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2152">interview</a> at the Wharton business school:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdlasica/2858261316/ style=" float: right;"><img border=0 src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2858261316_40a63f6dd5_m.jpg alt="Joss Whedon photo" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a>Whedon:</strong> We got so much of this done through people doing us favors — department heads and people who have access to things. But you've got to pay your day-to-day crew. The actors all did it for nothing. And we all did it for nothing. So, the production costs alone — the basic costs of filming the thing, and getting the locations, props and everything — ran a little over $200,000.</em></p>

<p><em>We had a secondary budget drawn up in case of a profit, wherein we were trying to find rates for Internet materials. In some cases they didn't exist. We used models that had been created by the guild for repurposed, or reused, material that we used for original [content], because this had never come up before.</em></p>

<p><em>We didn't want to leave a sour taste and say, "Well, we made some money off of you guys being kind." It was like: No, everybody has to benefit from what they've done, obviously not enormously — it's Internet money we're talking about — but as soon as we got in the black, we paid everybody off.</em></p>

<p><em>So that budget was probably about twice what the original budget was.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You've now earned more than twice the original cost?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> Yes.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Which members of the production shared in the profits on the backend?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> The crew that got paid, got paid. [Those] who didn't get paid [included people like] department heads who had jobs and could afford to do this as a lark.</em></p>

<p><em>As we go forward into profit, there are also residual schedules and payment schedules for all of the creative people. We're trying to figure out how that works.</em></p>

<p><em>From the start I also laid down a gross participation scheme for my three key actors and the other three writers. While the guild was negotiating for one-tenth of a yen, I said, "How about we just get into some percentages." It was an opportunity to say to the guilds, "Guess how much better we can do" — which, in the case of the Internet, is the only way for the guilds to survive.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've used a similar technique for internet startups, where the favors and the free time often fly wild and cause the entrepreneurs problems later.</p>

<p>My general rule of thumb is to get entrepreneurs to think one-third brains, one-third brawn, and one-third money. That is, people who bring knowledge, people, resources, brand, etc. get 1/3 of the outcome, people who actually work on the project get 1/3, and people who fronted the money or paid cash for expenses get the last third. Many people get a little equity from all three piles. If money comes in, the people who fronted cash get their money back first, then the other shares of revenues are distributed to everyone else based on the contributions.</p>

<p>It isn't a perfect model, but an afternoon of discussion with a team early on the entrepreneurial process--using this as a starting point for discussions — is often very successful in addressing future issues head-on before people become invested in differing expectations.</p>

<p>I suspect that many other industries may have interesting creative ideas on how to monetize favor if an outcome is good, but otherwise give out reciprocity of favors or social capital in the common good. Do you know of any of these?</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/bank_book.htm style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"><img src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c-320wi alt="Power of Conversation" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5f61c98970c "></a> I was musing as I was preparing for next week's Intensive at <a href=../2009/09/teaching-using-the-social-web-for-social-change-at-bgiedu.html>BGI</a> that I have 21 students in my class, an uncomfortable size. That's because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.</p>

<p>I talk about this a bit in my <a href=../2008/09/group-threshold.html>Group Threshold</a> and <a href=../2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html>Dunbar Number</a> posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the <a href=../2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number>“Judas Number”</a> nadir, or low point. These group threshold nadirs exist when groups are too large for some processes to function effectively, but too small for others to work.</p>

<p>I am particularly aware of this threshold when I host small parties at my home. At 7 or so people everything just seems to work — conversations flow, everybody gets to participate, and everyone has fun. A the numbers climb past 10 I find that I as the host have to work harder, to be more aware of making sure that everyone is having a good time and that no one is left out. At some point as a party gets larger things just begin to flow again, as there are enough people that small groups can form and conversation flows well once more.</p>

<p>I've also seen this at business meetings. When my entrepreneurial companies were small an “all hands” meeting could be incredibly effective. All the issues and ideas got brought up, and everyone felt committed to our decisions. However, as these meeting grew, at some point the “all hands” meeting took too long and started requiring process and rules to be effective. The energy this consumed also diminished much of the efficacy of the meeting.</p>

<p><a href=../files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border=1" title="Four Table Braid"><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2434/3959741597_77ffe2ca15_m.jpg alt="Four Table Braid" height=137 style="border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: black; border-right-color: black; border-bottom-color: black; border-left-color: black; " width=240 title="Card from Four Table Braid"></a>One tool that I've used to manage these odd-sized groups in the past is what I call “The Braid”. It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which <a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/>The World Café</a> and <a href=""></a><a href=http://www.conversationcafe.org/>Conversation Café</a> are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called <a href=http://www.theworldcafe.com/articles/cafetogo.pdf>Cafe To Go</a>.</p>

<p>The Braid is a little more organized then the more ad-hoc Café Method. When you start a meeting you are given a small card that tells you which table to sit at for each round. Each table is assigned a scribe for each round to take notes at the table, and to report out the notes to everyone who arrives for the next round.</p>

<p>One nice thing about the organization of The Braid is that over the course of a number of rounds you'll have a brand new group of people to talk to during each round. Thus over the course of an hour or so you'll actually get to have a relatively short yet rich conversation with almost everyone in the room, rather than with just a few.</p>

<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Four Table Braid"><img src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/3960601974_652a29b96f.jpg alt="Four Table Braid" height=453 width=433></a> There are different forms of The Braid for different numbers of tables and sizes of groups, but my favorite is the Four Table Braid for groups of a minimum of 16 to a maximum of 28 people. One of the peculiar things about this Braid is that it seems to function well if people arrive at different times. The Braid fills first table A with 4 people so that they can begin talking, then fills table B, C, and D the same way. Once those tables are full, new arrivals are woven into The Braid one at a time until all tables have 5 people, then 6, then the max of 7 for a total of 28 people.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about the Four Table Braid is that no one needs to be the scribe more then once; the task is equally shared among all but the last 8 to arrive in a group of 28. Also, in just 4 rounds with 16 people, 90%+ of the participants have met. With 28 people, you simply only need 5 rounds to match the same 90%+ meeting percentage.</p>

<p>I find The Braid useful for a variety of different situations. The simplest usage is as a group warming and introduction exercise. You need not do more then two or three rounds in order for more than half of the people to have met each other. The Braid is also useful with a focused objective. For instance, I once used it after a game designers' conference, with each table having a list of "game design laws" where the participants were asked to either give an example that was in favor of the law or contradicted the law. It also can be useful in combination with a variety of other group process techniques, for instance after an MG Taylor Take-A-Panel, where each participant first creates a page telling a story about themselves 15 years in the future and then the group uses The Braid to discover common insights. The Braid can also be good before an Open Space or other unconference event.</p>

<p>I am including here my templates for a <a href=../files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf>Four Table Braid</a>. It includes 28 cards for printing on Avery business card paper, 4 table pages with instructions for participants, and 1 page with instructions for the host. I make these available as <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/ rel=license>CC-BY-NC-SA</a> license. I welcome any DTP folks out there who would like to make these documents more functional or more attractive.</p>

<p>A Three Table Braid is easy to figure out by hand, but larger Braids are more difficult. I've never figured out an algorithm for designing these quickly (any math wizzes out there?) so I've posted my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0">spreadsheet</a> for the Four Table Braid for those of you who might wish to figure out how to implement larger numbers of tables. I would love to have a Ten Table Braid as a warm up exercise for a small unconference.</p>

<p>All types of venture investment -- seed, angel, venture, and institutional alike -- carry with it great risks and great rewards. But before we can reinvent venture capital and related venture funding methods like angel capital, we need to understand how it works.</p>

<h3>So What is a Venture Capitalist?</h3>

<p>A venture capitalist is a partner or associate in a venture capital management firm, which manages money on behalf of large institutional investors.</p>

<p>Basically, a large institutional investor (such as a pension fund or an insurance company) can statistically afford to invest a small part of their portfolio -- perhaps from 1% to as much as 5% -- in high-risk, long-term investments. If they lose the money outright, their other more stable investments have a good chance of making up the loss. But if the high risk investment does well, they can substantially improve their IRR (internal rate of return). To a certain extent they can't lose if they are careful. So these institutional investors invest in a number of types of high-risk funds, including such investments as venture capital funds.</p>

<p>A venture capital management company will manage one or more of these funds, investing in private companies. These VC management firms operate off of a management fee, from 2% to 3% of the capital invested to date. Thus all of the salaries for the staff of a VC management firm are paid, even if the investments are a failure. In addition, if any of the investments are successful, the VC management company earns 20% off of the top of the gain (called a "carry"), which is distributed to all of the full partners in the VC management firm, and sometimes a little of it to the associates.</p>

<p>It is the VC associates that do the brunt of the work for a VC management firm. They make a good salary, but the real return is if they are able to do well in identifying, managing, and selling new startups; then they are invited to become a partner the next time the VC management firm raises a fund. Then if the fund that they are a partner in does well, they can make a true fortune, or even start their own VC management firm.</p>

<p>However, the odds are against the VC associate. It's common wisdom that an associate can't easily manage more the 7 firms at a time. Other common wisdom says that 1 in 5 investments will survive to break even and that 1 in 20 will "make the fund", i.e. pay for all the losses in the other 19 investments. Some newer firms say 1 in 10, but I'll go with the older more conservative numbers. Thus associates are incentivized to try to manage more then 7 investments and to be smarter than their peers in the firm, so that at least one of their investments will be the 1 in 20 that makes the fund. This makes it easier for the associate to become a partner in the future, as at best 1 in 3 or 1 in 5 associates becomes a partner. Cutthroat competition between associates exists in some firms. This pressure often adds the perception that associates don't give enough attention to companies in their portfolio; they want their startups to do well, but the odds are it is another company that will make it, or a startup managed by peer associates. So they divide their attention. This is not unrelated to the <a href=../2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html>Dunbar Triage</a> problem.</p>

<p>Another problem that VC management firms face is the number of investments they are able to effectively handle. If there are 5-6 associates and 2-4 partners, there is probably a max of 50 investments that they have time to manage. If they are managing a $500 million dollar fund, that means that they have to invest at least $10M in a company, but in fact that is more likely to be $25M over time. If 1 in 20 makes the fund, that $25.0M has to give a return of $250M.  Thus when entrepreneurs complain that VCs will not invest in their company, it is often because the VCs can't figure out how to invest a minimum of $25M and turn out at the end with $250M. A related problem is that a startup that might have a successful business model that could grow into a profitable $50M annual revenues will be encouraged to take a more risky route so that they can go public, which requires a minimum of $100-200M annual revenues.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variety in VC management firms; some VCs have smaller funds under management, others give their associates more of a share, others have different management fees or carry percentages, and most specialize in some way: either vertically in a particular field, or horizontally in a particular stage of investment. For instance, there are some VC firms known as mezzanine firms that only invest in your company right before they think it can go public. </p>

<p>This is the way most VC management firms work. Periodically a new VC management firms will explore and push the limits of the above boundary conditions, but the more edges they attempt, the more likely they will fail.</p>

<h3>My Three Angels</h3>

<p>So what is an angel investor? I learned a lot of what I know from the 3 angel investors that invested in my software startup, Consensus Development.</p>

<h3>Gifford Pinchot -- Partner Angel</h3>

<p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/gif_and_libba.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=467,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/gif_and_libba.jpg alt=Gif_and_libba height=145 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Gif_and_libba></a>
Gifford Pinchot, with his wife Libba, was my first angel investor in Consensus Development. We met at a Maxis meeting where Gifford had been asked to facilitate the formation of a new startup to create simulation software. At the end of the meeting we left frustrated with the results of the meeting, but Gifford liked what he heard about my broader vision. Gifford flew me to San Diego, where we walked the beach and discussed my vision for collaborative software. He liked what he heard, and later in the month flew me to his home in Connecticut, where I stayed for a month in a barn guest house near his home while we worked on our first business plan.</p>

<p>Gifford only invested a low 5 figures, which got me started. However, it wasn't his money that was his most valuable contribution -- it was his time. Over the years he probably put 5-10% of his into time as Chairman of Consensus Development working with me, talking to me, advising me, and coached me. When our first software effort, InfoLog (a folksonomy tagging program like del.icio.us that was a decade too early) failed, he didn't walk away and instead encouraged me to continue. I dug deeper into the problem, discovered that trust and security were a key obstacle, and created a profitable consulting business. But Gifford encouraged me when I said we were going to take the risk of dropping all of our profitable consulting and focusing on a product, SSL Plus. Later, when this company was being shopped around to various buyers, Gifford spent lots of time doing due diligence, and ultimately came on half-time as CEO so that I could concentrate on selling the business.</p>

<p>In the end, Gifford earned probably 7 figures on his initial 5 figure investment, close to a hundred-fold return on the dollars he invested. However, his real investment was the time he spent with me -- almost 10 years of never giving up.</p>

<h3>Scott Loftesness -- Seed Angel</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.sjl.us><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/people_scott.jpg alt=People_scott title=People_scott style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"></a>
I met <a href=http://www.sjl.us/>Scott Loftesness</a> when he was the executive vice president at <a href=http://corporate.visa.com>Visa International</a>. We learned of each other through CompuServe, where we both were sysops in the 80s. I did some consulting for him at Visa in the groupware area over a couple of years and we grew to respect and trust each other. I came to him when I branched out from groupware consulting and began to include consulting on cryptographic security. I'd seen an opportunity--I had a potential contract from <a href=http://www.rsasecurity.com>RSA Data Security</a> to be a distributor of <a href=http://www.csm.ornl.gov/~dunigan/rsaref.txt>RSAREF</a>--but in order to take advantage of this opportunity I needed some seed capital.</p>

<p>Scott invested over twice what Gifford invested, but still 5 figures. However, like Gifford, what I gained from my association with Scott was a lot more then the seed capital. He had a respected name in the industry -- a friend at Visa USA told me "Scott is where all innovation at Visa flows from." He joined my board of directors, supported our risky choice to drop all groupware and cryptographic consulting to focus on our SSL project, helped tremendously in doing due diligence on potential buyers, and was pivotal to the negotiations to close our final sale of Consensus Development.</p>

<p>In the end, Scott Loftesness also did quite well in his investment in Consensus Development. His involvement on the day-to-day operation of Consensus Development was significantly less, but he was always around to support and advise us when we needed him.</p>

<h3>Jim Bidzos -- Hands-Off Angel</h3>

<p><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/bidzos.jpg alt=Bidzos title=Bidzos style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;">
Jim Bidzos was the CEO of RSA Data Security, whose firm had a critical patent on almost all meaningful cryptographic security. Over the years I did a lot of consulting for him to support various projects like RSAREF in standards, to create client tools for their Certificate Services Division, and to help with the founding of <a href=http://www.verisign.com>Verisign</a>.</p>

<p>One day I told Jim that RSAREF would never be successful in his goal of promoting the RSA algorithm in security standards as long as it could only be sold through RSA salespeople. They preferred to sell RSA's premiere toolkit, BSAFE. I somewhat jokingly proposed that maybe Consensus Development should sell it instead. To my surprise, he agreed.</p>

<p>A couple of years later I leveraged the fact that Consensus Development had the only RSA toolkit available other then RSA's own to get the contract to develop the reference implementation of SSL 3.0 for Netscape. I took this Netscape contract back to Jim and said that I needed some investment to make this successfully. He invested a middle six figures in Consensus Development in return for a percentage that was roughly equivalent to that of Gifford and Scott, but because of his involvement as CEO of RSA Data Security he could not be on our board of directors.</p>

<p>After this investment, Jim had very little to do with Consensus Development. In fact, he had spread his angel money so widely in the cryptographic security industry that he was also invested in a couple of our competitors. In the end his investment was worth roughly 10 times what he invested, but the cachet of being able to tell others that Jim Bidzos was an investor made Consensus Development much more "legitimate", which also added significant value to us.</p>

<h3>Founding of Alacrity Ventures</h3>

<p>After I left <a href=http://www.certicom.com/>Certicom</a>, the company that had purchased my firm, Consensus Development (see <a href=../2004/02/security_crypto.html>Bad Business of Fear</a> for more info), I wondered what I should do next. I could theoretically retire if I abandoned the Bay Area, but I was not ready for that and I thought I had maybe enough capital to start one more business of my own instead. Under a non-compete from Certicom, I was not sure what type of non-cryptographic business I wanted to start. So I decided that one thing I could do was some angel investing. In part this was to make money, but a larger part of it was that I enjoyed working with entrepreneurs. I wanted to do for others what Gifford Pinchot had done for me.</p>

<p>I did some study about how venture economics works, how angels and venture capital firms invest, and became concerned. I saw that being an angel investor in many ways is much harder then being a venture capitalist.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges is that angels share all the problems of the institutional investor, of the VC management firm, and of the VC associate.</p>

<p>The first challenge is deciding how much to invest. The institutional investors only risk 1%-5% of their capital. If I limited myself to that amount I could maybe invest in a couple of companies. I decided I was still young and could risk investing more.</p>

<p>The second problem was no management fee -- unlike a VC firm, angels don't get a management fee to cover salaries, legal fees, other expenses. </p>

<p>The third problem was my time. Most angels still work for a living -- being an angel investor is part-time, a venture capitalist typically works full-time. If only 1 in 20 investments "make the fund", but I could at most manage 7 investments, that meant that I had a 2/3rd's chance of losing my entire investment. I might be able to argue that for some kinds of businesses I might more informed than the average VC, and thus might be able to make better choices, but not <strong><em>that</em></strong> much better.</p>

<p><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/harold.jpg alt=Harold title=Harold style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;">
The key, I decided, was to work with at least 2 other angel investors. That would theoretically allow us to invest in 21 companies, diversify our portfolios, and split the work. I approached my first angel investor, Gifford Pinchot, and he agreed to be one of the partners. The second was <a href=http://www.alacrityventures.com/shattuck.html>Harold Shattuck</a>, who had done some due diligence and operations consulting for Consensus Development, and had been VC once before, but enjoyed being closer to the actual building of a new company with some operating interaction. I was the managing partner for files and accounting, but we all brought to the table our "deal flow", performed due diligence together, and worked closely with each other.</p>

<h3>Lessons from Alacrity Ventures</h3>

<p>Alacrity Ventures is over 6 years old, and I have learned many lessons from it.</p>

<p>First, I feel that we did a good job selecting our investments, during a time in which being an angel investor was very difficult. I discovered that Gifford, Harold and I were really good at due diligence; our differing skills, Gifford's in coaching and evaluating the management team, Harold's in operations and business models, and mine in technology truly complemented each other.</p>

<p>For a long time I could say that the good news was that that out of 13 investments, all but 1 were still in business. However, we were never able to invest in the 21 investments that we planned because we discovered a significant problem in angel investing: the VC.</p>

<p>The angel investor can only really afford to invest early on, as a seed investor, or in an early investment round such as series A. However, the firms we invested in needed more money along the way; in fact, almost all firms need money at more then one point. The venture climate at the time was such that the VCs required in their term sheets that previous investment rounds lose their <a href=http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2004/07/liquidation_pre.html>liquidation preferences</a>, and ultimately their investment.</p>

<p>Let me give a specific example -- we invested in a first round of an enterprise software company in 2000 that is still around today. In 2002 they needed more money, and because of the difficulty in getting VC investment, the lead VC insisted that the preferences from the previous rounds be removed, effectively making us common stock, unless we participated in this subsequent round. We reluctantly did invest some more, but because we don't have the funds that a VC has, we were only able to protect some of our preferred stock. A year and half later, the software company needed more money, and the VC did it again. This time, all our stock was converted to common. Now it is 2006, and the company might be acquired this year; however the VCs, because of their liquidation preferences, will get the first $65 million (or more). As I doubt the firm is worth more then $50M, we will not get anything, nor will any of the other founders that are no longer involved with the firm.</p>

<p>This has repeated itself over and over again. We made a decent choice and did our due diligence well, but subsequent VC investors have pushed us out. A few of our ventures have failed outright. That is understandable given our original 1 in 20 expectations. But what we didn't expect was how difficult it was going to be to participate in the upside. Yes, we had preferences in our early rounds that should have protected us, but they didn't.</p>

<p>So of our 13 investments, only 2 remain that may "make the fund": a very innovative high-tech titanium powder manufacturer <a href=http://www.itponline.com/>ITT</a>, and a high-tech manufacturer of ceramic devices <a href=http://www.vapore.com/>Vapore</a>. But even as these two investments survive, they are still vulnerable to requiring additional investment and possibly forcing us out.</p>

<p>Of the rest: one of our early investments sold to VeriSign at a 50% premium, our investment in <a href=http://www.salon.com>Salon.com</a> will give us a small return, <a href=http://www.mgtaylor.com>MG Taylor</a> paid off its loan, and <a href=http://www.skotos.net>Skotos</a> may someday pay back its original investment. The other 8 are being written off as a loss.</p>

<h3>Advice to Angels</h3>

<p>So in spite of the odds, you still want to become an angel investor? Here is some advice...</p>

<p><strong>Collaborate with other angels:</strong> Going it alone is dangerous -- there are a number of angel investor networks, such as <a href=http://gatheringofangels.com/>Gathering of Angels</a>, <a href=http://www.bandangels.com/>Band of Angels</a> and others in listed the <a href=http://www.inc.com/articles/2001/09/23461.html>Directory of Angel-Investor Networks</a>. Be careful, though, the enthusiasm of others can be contagious -- don't always go with the herd.</p>

<p><strong>Do your own due diligence:</strong> I can't emphasize this enough. Talk to the entrepreneurs and meet their staff. Read their business plan and tear it apart. Find the hidden assumptions. Understand their business model. It needs to feel realistic. Try to get more eyes on the job: different people see different things. Don't follow others; they may have different investment criteria then your own.</p>

<p><strong>Be an advisor first:</strong> Be an advisor first -- if the entrepreneurs don't listen to your advice, don't invest. If you have to invest to become an advisor, invest only a small amount, or have part of the money be contingent on a meaningful goal.</p>

<p><strong>Guard your upside:</strong> When negotiating terms, don't worry about the downside. It is the VCs that need items on the term sheet for when things go wrong -- what you need to guard is for when things go right. Watch for changes in the executive staff -- they may be incentivized differently than you are.</p>

<p><strong>Consider a secured loan:</strong> Somewhat contrary to the "guard your upside" advice, rather then investing only in stock, consider investing via a secured loan as well. The security can not only be on hard company assets, but intellectual property such as copyrights, trademarks or patents. Your return will be lower on the loan, but if you can get all of your investment back early and get a small percentage of the company, it can be a good way to balance risk. Just remember to file the property documents to make sure that the assets are properly secured, and be prepared that someday you may own that asset.</p>

<p><strong>Save $2 for every $1:</strong> Almost every company you invest in, even if successful, will need additional funding. Make sure that you keep on hand $2 for every $1 initially invested. This will also help you from being squeezed out by later VC investors.</p>

<p><strong>Invest in acquisition targets:</strong> Let the VCs take companies public -- the companies that you should be interested are the companies that will eventually be acquired. Creating an acquisition target requires the management to think differently -- coach them to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the founders dilemma:</strong> There are many <a href=http://www.businessleader.com/bl/mar01/feature1.html>founders dilemmas</a>, however, one is particularly important to the angel investor. A founder may be incentivized to sell sooner then his early investors. Remember that most often, the only significant asset that a founder has is his company. If the founder has an opportunity to sell early and buy a house, he might, even if it may not be enough return on investment for the risk that the angel took. Find ways to keep your interest aligned with that of the founders, which may include even buying some stock directly from the founder.</p>

<p><strong>Consider alternative exits:</strong> There are lots of boutique opportunities that are too small for VCs. I know of a local Berkeley software company that was number one in their market, but too small to go public. They had $20M in annual revenues, and profits of almost $10M, but little opportunity for growth -- early investors could have gotten their money back in dividends rather than sale of the company.</p>

<p><strong>Time the cycle:</strong> We didn't invest at the ideal time for the angel investor. We picked well considering the times, but had we waited for a few years it would have been easier. Not to say that timing is everything; we'd have lost our titanium powder opportunity if we'd waited for better market timing.</p>

<p><strong>Respect people:</strong> Treat the people you invest in like a paying client. Respect their time and concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Be prepared that the plan will change:</strong> I've never been involved with a business where the business plan doesn't significantly change. As an angel investor you need to help your businesses to plan for those changes.</p>

<h3>Advice to Entrepreneurs</h3>

<p>So you want investment from an angel investor? Some advice...</p>

<p><strong>Recognize the odds:</strong> The angel investor is taking a substantial risk investing in your company -- you need to be able show a scenario where the investor might be able to make 10x or 20x their investment. So if you are looking for $100K, you need to show how the angel can ultimately have stock worth $1M to $2M.</p>

<p><strong>Consider their advice:</strong> Angel investors may not always be right, but show them that you are listening. If you use angels for more then just a source of money, you'll get a lot more value from them.</p>

<p><strong>Draft your business plan:</strong> An angel investor does not need as complete a business plan as a VC does, but they need to see how you think. You should clearly identify what the product or service is, who is going to buy it, what is the marketplace that those buyers may find it in, what differentiates your product or service and why your team is good enough to deliver. Angel investors know that your plan will change, probably drastically, but if they understand your thinking process they can be more confident that your company will survive change.</p>

<p><strong>It takes time:</strong> Don't count on the money from an angel investor (or any investor) until you get the check. Investors are always selecting from a number of choices, often very competitive choices. No matter how optimistic you are, it is likely it will take 6 months or likely more to raise angel money.</p>

<p><strong>Team with Many Hats:</strong> Angel investors don't recruit new team members for you. You don't necessarily have to have your whole team in place, but there at least needs to be someone who has experience managing, someone with development experience, someone with marketing experience, and someone with sales experience. Whatever team is there, they need to be able to juggle all of those hats. Financial, HR, and administrative positions can all be part-time or farmed out.</p>

<h3>Advice to Venture Capitalists</h3>

<p><strong>Value the angel investor:</strong> The angel investor serves a point in the marketplace that you are not able to serve. Rather then driving them out, find some way for them to continue to participate so that they can find other ventures for you.</p>

<p><strong>Angels are not VCs:</strong> The angel investor can't afford to invest in later rounds -- their model is different than yours. It may make sense to force participation in subsequent rounds by other VCs, but carve out some room for angels.</p>

<h3>The future of Alacrity Ventures</h3>

<p>Though I've enjoyed some aspects of being an angel investor, I enjoy working with creative people to innovate new products more. I expect to spend most of my time in the next few years continuing to explore social software and collaboration tools, and the new product opportunities that may evolve from them.</p>

<p>Thus I expect that any future angel investments I make will be more along the lines of Gifford's style of investment in Consensus Development: a small investment of money and a large investment of time. Harold and Gifford both feel the same way. Currently we plan to continue monitoring our existing investments, but don't plan any new investments unless we can take a more active role in the firm -- for instance Harold is a board member in Vapore.</p>

<p>Gifford is now dedicating his life to building a better world by transforming business education. He is a co-founder and President of the <a href=http://www.bgiedu.org>Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>, which provides an MBA program integrating sustainability, green economics, the internet, and open source within a traditional MBA program. As an open source school, he helps other schools to use BGI’s curriculum. Check out his blog entry on <a href=http://blogs.pinchot.com/gifsplace/2006/02/angel_philanthr.html>Angel Philanthropy</a>.<br> </p>

<p>If there's one thing we've learned from six years of angel investing, one thing that may be more valuable than all the nuts and bolts I describe here, it's that Gifford Pinchot's partner-style of angel investment is what suits our investing style, not Jim Bidzos' style of hands-off angel investing, and that's a lesson that we're going to carry forward with Alacrity Ventures.</p>
