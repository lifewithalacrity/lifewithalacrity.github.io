			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/committing_to_v.html">&lt;p&gt;We have experimented with VoIP software since 1992 -- and, of course, nothing worked well until recently.  A consultant friend mentioned that he takes his Vonage box when he travels in the US and Europe so he can answer and make calls using his L.A. phone number.  I recently converted one POTS line to Vonage and the quality is good, the features are great, and we&amp;#39;re saving money.  Vonage should do well with this combination. &lt;/p&gt;</content>
