                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-pi style="float: right;" class=asset-img-link><img alt=Consensus-flowchart src=../../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-320wi style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title=Consensus-flowchart class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c img-responsive"></a>I have made understanding of consent and consensus, in both their human and technological forms, a major part of my career. I have explored them through my work in cryptographic technologies, but also in human terms at the <a href=http://groupworksdeck.org/ title="Group Pattern Language Project" target=_self>Group Pattern Language Project</a>, by co-authoring with Shannon Appecline forthcoming book on the design of collaborative games, and another book in progress on the patterns of cooperative play. My business management style is also more collaborative and inclusive.</p>
<p>This topic is so important to me that I named the company I founded in 1988 (that eventually led the effort to establish TLS 1.0 as an internet standard) was named "Consensus Development" (<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/19980709005818/http://www.consensus.com/ target=_self>archive.org</a>).</p>
<p>Thus I've been fascinated this week to watch a major online community try to define for itself what “consent” and “consensus” in their community will mean. This community in question is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency community, which is faced with a minority of the community attempting to “hard fork”. This weekend they <a href=https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/ target=_self>meet in Montreal </a>to attempt to discover another way to return to some form of unanimity and broad consent of their stakeholders.</p>
<p>This is of the hardest problems in human interactions. Consent comes from the Latin, meaning “feel together”, which this community now believes they lack. But it is particularly poignant that this particular community is facing these questions. Bitcoin is technologically based on a formal protocol that uses a mathematical and cryptographic method for consensus called the “blockchain”. Every 10 minutes, thousands of nodes and hundreds of miners arrive at a consensus on all the bitcoin transactions during that time. Bitcoin, and the larger Blockchain community are the worlds experts on cryptographic forms of consensus. But the human consensus problem is still hard for them too.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">A Spectrum of Consent</span></p>
<p>In my recent efforts into understanding this topic, and some recent dives into my  <a href=../../2005/12/systems_for_col.html title="Systems for Collective Choice (start of series)" target=_self>Systems For Collective Choice</a>, the topic of the <em>A Spectrum Of Consent</em> has repeatedly come up. There appear to be a range of levels of consent required for various deliberative processes and voting systems.</p>
<p>I have had these incomplete notes on the Spectrum of Consent around for a couple of years, which I've only shared privately. However, given my discussions this week at the <a href=http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/ target=_self>Consensus 2015</a> conference and elsewhere, it was time to share. I welcome comments and suggestions!</p>
<p>Basically, many groups view consensus processes as a requirement, however, many others see consensus processes as unworkable and a serious problem to be avoided. These efforts to define <em>A Spectrum Of Consent</em> are somewhat to help me understand this dichotomy. I personally believe that certain deliberative processes and voting systems are good for some things, some for others. But I find I'm rare in that opinion — most people lean strongly in way one or the other.</p>
<p>There is clearly some conflation and orthogonality in my list below of types of representation (who decides), deliberation (how you approach a decision), and choice selection method (voting system), but I think this is a good start at defining a spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Consensus (or Absolute Agreement)</strong> — A voting system where all parties are required support and agree to a decision, without anyone voting to neither agree or disagree (aka abstaining).</p>
<p><strong>Unanimous Consent (or Unanimity)</strong> — A voting system where all parties support and agree to a decision, however, some parties may abstain by raising no objections.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Decision Making</strong> — A deliberative process of reaching unanimous consent (everyone agrees or abstains) with a number of procedural rules or cultural norms that limit blocking. Most forms of Consensus Decision Making all members have equal voice in the deliberation and equal vote. Most ask a closing question question such as "Are there any remaining unresolved concerns?" or "Are there any paramount objections?". Some believe that in Consensus Decision Making that there is never a “vote”. (Another <a href=http://www.community4me.com/consensus.html target=_self>definition of consensus</a>) (PDF on the <a href=http://seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus.pdf title="Consensus PDF" target=_self>Consensus Process</a>) and (<a href=https://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/when-not-to-use-consensus/ title="When to not use Consensus" target=_self>when to not use consensus</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sense of Meeting</strong> — A deliberative deliberative process practice as originally created by the Quakers. It is related to consensus which seeks “unity in the discernment of a decision” It is not necessary for every member to fully agree with a decision, but rather for members “to discern that as a body they are called in a particular direction.”</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Minus One</strong> — A voting system where a party may block only if they can find at least one other uninvolved party to agree to join together to block. Otherwise the decision passes.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Seeking</strong> — A deliberation process that attempt to reach unanimous consent, but can fall back to a majority vote when required. Essentially Consensus Decision Making in deliberative process — listening to those with objections, but the ability to go to a vote stops the "tyranny of the minority" that sometimes happens with consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Mediated Consensus</strong> — Related to Consensus Seeking. An immediate decision can be made by consensus, but if that fails the blockers and proponents have to meet separately with or without a mediator, and if they still don't agree then its brought back to the next meeting for a vote. </p>
<p><strong>Distributed Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)</strong> — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. Consensus is required within each group but not of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Consequential Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)</strong> — Only those affected by the outcome of the decision can participate and vote in the decision, which requires consensus of all those affected.</p>
<p><strong>Representative Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)</strong> — Each party who participates in the deliberation votes represents the interests of others by some rules. Consensus is required only among the representatives.</p>
<p><strong>Appreciative Inquiry Based Deliberation (another one needing naming)</strong> — A deliberative process that focuses on moving forward on moving forward on things that there is agreement on that are "the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur."</p>
<p><strong>Blocking or Vetoing Representation</strong>— Voting systems where one or more members may have the right to block the deliberative process before a vote, or veto after a vote.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Super Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be larger than a simple majority based on the entire membership rather than only on those present and voting, typically 2/3rds.</p>
<p><strong>Super Majority or Qualified Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be greater than a simple majority of those present and voting, typically 2/3rds of those voting.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be 50% + 1 vote, based on the entire membership rather than on those present and voting.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be 50% + 1 vote of those present and voting.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of Order or Parliamentary Procedure</strong> — A deliberative process such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order target=_self>Robert's Rules of Order</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure target=_self>other rules</a> used by legislative bodies such as a senate or parliaments, but  often used by corporations for decision making such as a board of directors meeting.  At their heart is the rule of the majority with respect for the minority. Its object is to allow deliberation upon questions of interest to the group and to arrive at the sense or the will of the organization as a whole upon these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Plurality or Relative Majority</strong> — A voting system where when there are multiple options, the largest number of votes wins.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Fork</strong> — Unique to open source communities, consensus can be reached by having the stakeholders lacking consensus to split off to form their own consensus, and since the assets are largely intellectual the can compete equally for the attention of the community and markets they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen Assembly (sometimes called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition title=sortition target=_self>sortition</a>, public sector representation, jury or allotment)</strong> — A deliberative process where a representative random sample of eligible voters is selected to make binding decisions for the group. The voting system used may be consensus or some form of majority. Ancient Athenian democracy actually form of this of this in the Boule and Jury.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Authority</strong> — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. How each group makes decisions is decided by that group.</p>
<p><strong>Executive Authority</strong> — Rules for how a party is elected to represent a group, who then has authority to make decisions for that group, typically for a limited period of time.</p>
<p><strong>Dictatorship</strong> — Executive authority exercised to ensure a monopoly of authority by its elected representative.</p>

<p>I'm heading out today to New York City to speak at <a href=http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/>Consensus 2015</a>, where I am speaking on the panel <em>‘Bitcoin and its Antecedents: A Look at the History and Evolution of Digital Cash’</em>:</p>
<blockquote>Bitcoin is far from the first attempt at creating a form of digital money with the potential to upend existing systems. Our panelists will look at bitcoin's predecessors and close cousins. Nathaniel Popper wrote the book Digital Gold, which delves into bitcoin's genesis; Christopher Allen is an internet security expert who has been involved in digital cash systems including Digicash for decades, while Garrick Hileman is CoinDesk's lead analyst and an economic historian at the LSE, specializing in alternative and private monies.</blockquote>
<p>This invite probably came about from an extended interview that Tim Swanson, author of the blockchain book and blog <a href=http://www.ofnumbers.com>The Great Wall of Numbers</a>, shared with his readers. Tim wrote me saying <em>“There is some dispute, apparently, of the history and precursors of distributed computing / consensus before Bitcoin<em>”</em></em>, and and asked me if I would share my <em>“own view of what a blockchain is defined as, what Nakamoto consensus is relative to other 'solutions' to Byzantine faults, triple entry accounting, etc.”</em> He published my answers in his post <a href=http://www.ofnumbers.com/2015/07/09/a-blockchain-with-emphasis-on-the-a/>A blockchain with emphasis on the ‘a’</a>. For posterity, I thought I'd also share my part of the interview here:</p>
<p>I certainly was an early digital currency banner waiver — I did some consulting work with Xanadu, and later for the very early Digicash. At various points in the growth of SSL both First Virtual and PGP tried to acquire my company. When I saw Nick’s “<a href=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548/469>First Monday</a>” article the day it came out, as it immediately clicked a number of different puzzle pieces that I’d not quite put together into one place. I immediately started using the term smart contracts and was telling my investors, and later Certicom, that this is what we really should be doing (maybe because I was getting tired of battles in SSL/TLS standards when that wasn’t what Consensus Development had been really founded to solve).</p>
<p>However, in the end, I don’t think any thing I did actually went anywhere, either technically or as a business, other than maybe getting some other technologists interested. So in the end I’m more of a witness to the birth of these technologies than a creator.</p>
<p>History in this area is distorted by software patents—there are a number of innovative approaches that would be scrapped because of awareness of litigious patent holders. I distinctly remember when I first heard about some innovative hash chain ideas that a number of us wanted to use hash trees with it, but we couldn’t figure out how to avoid the 1979 Merkle Hash Tree patent whose base patent wouldn’t expire until ’96, as well as some other subsidiary hash tree and time stamp patents that wouldn’t expire until early 2000s.</p>
<p>As I recall, at the time were we all trying to inspired solve the micropayment problem. Digicash had used cryptography for larger-sized cash transactions, whereas First Virtual, Cybercash and others were focused on securing the ledger side and needed larger transaction fees and thus larger amounts of money to function. To scale down we were all looking at hash chain ideas from Lamport’s S/KEY from the late 80’s and distributed transactional ledgers from X/Open’s DTP from the early 90s as inspirations. DEC introduced Millicent during this period, and I distinctly remember people saying “this will not work, it requires consumers to hold keys in a electronic wallet”. On the cryptographic hash side of this problem Adam Back did Hashcash, Rivest and his crew introduced PayWord and Micromint. On the transaction side CMU introduced <a href=http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/documents/netbill.pdf>NetBill</a>.</p>
<p>Nick Szabo wrote using hashes for post-unforgeable transaction logs in his original <a href=http://szabo.best.vwh.net/formalize.html>smart contract paper</a> in ’97, in which he referred to <a href="Surety’s work">Surety’s work</a> (and they held the Merkle hash tree and other time signature patents), but in that original paper he did not look at Proof-of-Work at all. It was another year before he, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney started talking about using proof-of-work as a possible foundational element for smart contracts. I remember some discussions over beer in Palo Alto circa ’99 with Nick after I became CTO of Certicom about creating dedicated proof-of-work secure hardware that would create tokens that could be used as an underlying basis for his smart contract ideas. This was interesting to Certicom as we had very good connections into cryptographic hardware industry, and I recommended that we should hire him. Nick eventually joined Certicom, but by that point they had cancelled my advanced cryptography group to raise profits in order to go public in the US (causing me to resign), and then later ceased all work in that area when the markets fell in 2001.</p>
<p>I truly believe that would could have had cryptographic smart contracts by ’04 if Certicom had not focused on short-profits (see Solution #3 at bottom of <a href=../../2004/02/security_crypto.html>this post</a> for my thoughts back in 2004 after a 3-year non-compete and NDA)…</p>
<blockquote>What is required, I believe, is a major paradigm shift. We need to leave the whole business of fear behind and instead embrace a new model: using cryptography to enable business rather than to prevent harm. We need to add value by making it possible to do profitable business in ways that are impossible today. There are, fortunately, many cryptographic opportunities, if we only consider them. Cryptography can be used to make business processes faster and more efficient. With tools derived from cryptography, executives can delegate more efficiently and introduce better checks and balances. They can implement improved decision systems. Entrepreneurs can create improved auction systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nick Szabo is one of the few developers who has really investigated this area, through his work on Smart Contracts. He has suggested ways to create digital bearer certificates, and has contemplated some interesting secure auctioning techniques and even digital liens. Expanding upon his possibilities we can view the ultimate Smart Contract as a sort of Smart Property. Why not form a corporation on the fly with digital stock certificates, allow it to engage in its creative work, then pay out its investors and workers and dissolve? With new security paradigms, this is all possible.</blockquote>
<p>When I first heard about Bitcoin, I saw it as having clearly two different parts. First was a mix of old ideas about unforgeable transaction logs using hash trees combined into blocks connected by hash chains. This clearly is the “blockchain”. But in order for this blockchain to function, it needed timestamping, for which fortunately all the patents had expired. The second essential part of Bitcoin was through a proof-of-work system to timestamp the blocks, which clearly was based on Back’s HashCash rather than the way transactions were timestamped in Szabo’s BitGold implementation.</p>
<p>I have to admit, when I first saw it I didn’t really see much in Bitcoin that was innovative — but did appreciate how it combined a number of older ideas into one place. I did not predict its success, but thought it was an interesting experiment and that might lead to a more elegant solution. (BTW, IMHO Bitcoin became successful more because of how it leveraged cypherpunk memes and their incentives to participate in order to bootstrap the ecosystem rather than because of any particularly elegant or orginal cryptographic ideas).</p>
<p>In my head, Bitcoin consists of blocks of cryptographic transactional ledgers chained together, plus one particular approach to time-stamping this block chain that uses proof-of-work method of consensus. I’ve always thought of blockchain and mining as separate innovations.</p>
<p>To support this separation for your article, I have one more <a href=http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html>quote</a> to offer you from Nick Szabo:</p>
<blockquote>Instead of my automated market to account for the fact that the difficulty of puzzles can often radically change based on hardware improvements and cryptographic breakthroughs (i.e. discovering algorithms that can solve proofs-of-work faster), and the unpredictability of demand, Nakamoto designed a Byzantine-agreed algorithm adjusting the difficulty of puzzles. I can’t decide whether this aspect of Bitcoin is more feature or more bug, but it does make it simpler.</blockquote>
<p>As to your question of when the community first started using the word consensus, I am not sure. The cryptographic company I founded in 1988 that eventually created the reference implementation of SSL 3.0 and offered the first TLS 1.0 toolkits was named “Consensus Development” so my memory is distorted. To me, the essential problem has always been how to solve consensus. I may have first read it about it in “The Ecology of Computation” published in 1988 which predicted many distributed computational approaches that are only becoming possible today, which mentions among other things such concepts as Distributed Scheduling Protocols, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance, Computational Auctions, etc. But I also heard it from various science fiction books of the period, so that is why I named my company after it.</p>
