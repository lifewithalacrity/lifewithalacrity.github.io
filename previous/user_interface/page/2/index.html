					<h3 class=entry-header><a href=../../../2005/10/for_the_last_se.html>SynchroEdit: Simultaneous Editing for the Web</a></h3>
		



		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>For the last several months I've been working on a new open source project that I've been calling <a href=http://www.synchroedit.com>SynchroEdit</a>. SynchroEdit is a browser-based simultaneous multiuser editor, useful for <a href=http://www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/rng/teaching/notes/CSCWgroupware.html>"same-time" collaboration</a>.</p>

<p><a href=../../../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/synchroeditmac.png onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=493,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../../../images/synchroeditmac.png alt=Synchroeditmac height=202 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=262 title=Synchroeditmac></a>The basic concept is that it allows multiple users to WYSIWYG edit a single web-based document, all at exactly the same time. SynchroEdit continuously synchronizes all changes so that users always see the same version. They can also see each others' changes as they type, see where each user is currently editing, and see each others' changes by color.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is a tool for "same-time" collaboration, either "same-time, different-place", as in teleconference calls, or "same-time, same-place", during a meeting or a conference. If you've ever used <a href=http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/>SubEthaEdit</a> on Mac OS X, or <a href=http://www.moonedit.com>MoonEdit</a> for Windows or Linux, or the cross-platform <a href=http://gobby.0x539.de/>Gobby</a>, this is a similar experience. The difference is that unlike those tools you are not limited to just plain text -- character styles (bold, italic, etc.) and paragraph styles (rulers, headers, blockquotes, etc) are synchronized as well. And of course, it all works inside your browser.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is inspired by my frustration with the lack of an easily accessible cross-platform simultaneous editor. Many times when I've been on the phone with a colleague discussing a draft blog entry, or demonstrating some code, or on a teleconference call with others to discuss a proposal or a standard, or at a conference taking notes with others, I've wanted to have this tool. The rare occasions that we all have been on the same platform and have been able to use an existing tool have demonstrated to me the value of having a good simultaneous editor. Having SynchroEdit available will make it easier for people to have these positive collaborative experiences.Â  </p>

<p>I have a long history with "same-time" collaboration tools -- back in 1988 I was briefly executive producer at Broderbund for a same-time groupware product called <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1cDDTqwlqGoJ:www.the-scientist.com/yr1988/jul/software_p22_880725.html+%2Bbroderbund+%2B%22for+comment%22+groupware">For Comment</a>. Unfortunately, the success of the Nintendo game console forced Broderbund to drop all of their non-consumer product efforts. In the early 90's I worked on several different "same-time same-place" groupware tools for live meetings. Most recently, my game company <a href=http://www.skotos.net>Skotos Tech</a>, created several browser-based "enhanced chat" clients for playing in MUSH-like storytelling games, which are also "same-time".</p>



<p>I personally believe that that this capability should be a fundamental feature of the web, sort of the obvious extension of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee>Tim Berners-Lee's</a> <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4132752.stm>vision</a> of the editable web. Thus my desire to offer this tool as open source, allowing anyone to add this capability to their own software (unlike proprietary editor services such as <a href=http://www.jotlive.com>JotLive</a> or <a href=http://www.writely.com/>Writely</a>).</p>



<p>The challenge with offering SynchroEdit as open source is finding a business model -- unlike an application like <a href=http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/>SubEthaEdit</a> or a service like <a href=http://www.jotlive.com>JotLive</a>, it is difficult to get revenues from individual users. Instead, we ask for contributions from companies that might find the tool useful, we offer consulting to customize it for specific purposes, and we give these companies public credit for their contributions to the common good.</p>

<p>The first company to step up to the plate is <a href=http://www.socialtext.com>SocialText</a>, an enterprise wiki company. Clearly, being able to offer this capability to their customers will give them added value, and they already have a history of using open source with their support of <a href=http://www.kwiki.org/>Kwiki</a> and <a href=http://www.wikiwyg.net/>Wikiwyg</a>.</p>

<p>The second supporter is venture capitalist and blogger <a href=http://joi.ito.com/>Joichi Ito</a>. He is is particularly well known for his own experiments with "same-time" collaboration. He runs a continuous #joiito IRC chat room, active 24 hours a day with hundreds of his friends. He also has done many live "same-time" experiments with chat backchannel during his talks at various conferences.</p>

<p>In addition to to financial support of SocialText and Joichi Ito, I have some offers of help from the <a href=http://www.bgiedu.org>Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>, who plan to use it in its socially responsible and environmentally sustainable MBA program, and we've also taken advantage of some code developed by <a href=http://www.skotos.net/>Skotos</a>.</p>

<p>The development of SynchroEdit is being led by Kalle Alm, a young Swedish coder I met when he was creating an online game at Skotos. Skotos has long had the vision of having games created by its members, and Kalle Alm was the first member to create a game completely from scratch using Skotos' tools.</p>

<p>We are seeking more financial contributions so that we can accelerate development. Currently SynchroEdit only works in Mozilla/Firefox, and I anticipate that making it work with Internet Explorer may be quite difficult, so we'll need more partners to help.</p>

We have additional information on the program, a <a href=http://wiki.synchroedit.com>developers wiki</a>, as well as a sandbox that you can play in to demonstrate SynchroEdit in use.</p>

                                <p>If you read my blog through an aggregator, you may not have noticed my new sidebar "Recent Bookmarks". It is a list of web pages that I've found interesting enough to annotate using the <a href=http://del.icio.us/>del.icio.us</a> service. It is useful if you want to have an insight into what future blog entries I'm working on, as links will often show up there before my actual blog posting is out.</p>

<p>You alternatively can <a href="http://del.icio.us/ChristopherA?setcount=10">view my last 10 del.icio.us postings</a>, or subscribe to my <a href=http://del.icio.us/rss/ChristopherA>del.icio.us RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in offering this feature in your own blog, I used the <a href=http://www.bigbold.com/rssdigest/>RSS Digest</a> webservice to create a javascript applet that formats information from my del.icio.us RSS feed into a format suitable for my sidebar. There are a lot of other cool things that are possible with this service.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I've been working on an ambitious list of topics that I'd like to cover over the next year. I offer them to you here so you can have some idea the areas that I am thinking about.</p>

<p><strong><em>Office Architecture for Innovation</em></strong> -- Over the years I've built or converted three offices to my specifications. From this I have learned a number of things about about how to create a productive environment innovation-oriented businesses. These include some of the obvious suggestions such as fresh air and natural light, but also include not so obvious ideas such as using magnetic paint and providing a small washer-dryer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Requisite Variety</em></strong> -- This concept from cybernetics applies to social systems as well. "The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate." More people, as well as a diversity of thinking styles and experience, give social software more "variety of actions", thus this is part of the reason why social software can be so effective.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Art and Craft of Meme Design</em></strong> -- We are learning more about how to create an effective meme. Creating memes has always been an art performed by publicists, marketers, politicians, the press, and to a lesser extent by scientists and other academics. Have we learned enough to turn this art into an explicit craft?</p>

<p><strong><em>Wiki Editing Dichotomy</em></strong> -- One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the "wiki editing dichotomy". You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don't know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.</p>

<p><strong><em>Choice &amp; Neuroeconomics</em></strong> -- There are some that say at the root of every decision is emotion. Even a 'rational' decision appeals to a sense of balance or beauty. Recent studies using PET are establishing a neurological basis for emotions, and some reveal interesting facts about how we make choices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Assessing Risk</em></strong> -- There are a variety of areas where we as humans have a difficult time being completely rational. One of these is risk assessment. It turns out we may be hard-wired to not be able toeasily understand risk that is greater then one in a hundred or so. Thus a very rare risk, say one in a thousand, will often be emotionally interpreted as having a much higher risk.</p>


<p><strong><em>Persuasive Computing</em></strong> -- BJ Fogg's group at Stanford has done some interesting research on how computers can persuade you to do something. There are a number of useful ideas that come from this research. There are also some ethical considerations that should be discussed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cognitive Dissonance</em></strong> -- This technique is central to many forms of persuasion intended to change beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors. It is used by facilitators, businesses, military organizations, and even cults. It can be used positively or negatively. How might it be used in social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>The Dark Side of the Force</em></strong> -- The same social tools that we use for good, can also be used for harm. How do we ethically use what we are learning about social software? Some say that almost by definition social software attracts spammers, trolls, and innappropriate sexuality. What can we do to prevent these misuses of social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Conversation vs Communication</em></strong> -- Update and rewrite of my <a href=http://www.alacritymanagement.com/GCnC.html>1990 essay</a> on how social software design needs to balance conversation vs communication.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Emotions</em></strong> -- We appear to have evolved a number of emotions that appear primarily to exist to support a common good, rather then to ensure our individual success. These include schadenfreude, mirth, naches, revenge, shame, pride, outrage, approbation, admiration, elevation, etc. Studies by Eckman on unconscious facial gestures, studies on the neurological basis for emotions, and studies on emotions in games, are proving that these social emotions exist. A number of them have interesting implications on social software.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glances &amp; Strokes</em></strong> -- There is some old work on the amount of eye contact we make with others in small groups, as well as some research from transactional analysis on strokes, which are the amount of recognition given to others through words and deeds. Is there a neurological basis for needing a certain number of glances and strokes each day? How does this concept apply to social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Weak Links</em></strong> -- There are some interesting social implications behind what we've learned about weak links in social networks. How do we identify and encourage weak links in our social software systems?</p>

<p><strong><em>Negativity vs Positivity</em></strong> -- It is far easier for someone to respond negativel than positively. In political systems it is far easier to say no rather then yes. What social software encourages positivity, and is it possible to design social software to do so?</p>

<p><strong><em>Time Economy</em></strong> -- Our ultimate most unrenewable resource is time. How time and attention are a basic economic unit that should be considered when looking at social software.</p>


<p><strong><em>Group Life Cycle</em></strong> -- We often focus on how groups form, emerge, and grow. Yet there are many lessons to be learned from how groups die, including that it isn't necessarily a bad thing and that keeping a group from death can be dysfunctional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Groupthink</em></strong> -- What causes groupthink? When is it good and when is it bad?</p>


<p><strong><em>Two Thresholds in the Value of Knowledge</em></strong> -- In order for knowledge to be valuable, it must at minimum be more valuable then the costs to find and absorb it (costs which include bandwidth and attention). Tools like Google have tremendously increased the amount of knowledge that is worth the time and attention to find it. What types of knowledge fall below this threshold of value? Is there a limit to how much we can lower this line? Furthermore, there is another threshold where the knowledge is significantly more valuable than only bandwidth and attention. How much have internet tools impacted this second threshold? Many internet business models, in particular content models, require some ability to offer value in this upper threshold -- can they survive as this upper threshold changes?</p>

<p><strong><em>Intimacy and Social Networks</em></strong> -- Social Networks Analysis tends to focus on the connections between people, either explicitly through acknowledgement of connections (LinkedIn, Friendster) or implicitly through analysis of your communication (Spoke). None are able to measure intimacy. Yet our intimate social networks are an important component of our overall happiness and contentment within both our professional and personal lives. How does intimacy work in social networks? Also there are some concepts in psychology known as communal vs exchange relationships by Clark &amp; Mills from late 70's that may apply here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Games</em></strong> -- A recap of Shannon Appelcline's and my analysis of the basic forms of social games types. These include relatively well understood ones like majority control, voting, meta-voting (Nomic), auctioning, etc., but also include less well understood games like playing of roles, dominance and submission, etc. There are also links to social emotions, such as mirth and schadenfraude.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Castle Marrach</em></strong> -- We released the Castle Marrach online game in September of 2000, and it was designed from the beginning to be a game for the Bartle-type known as "the socializer". What lessons did we learn in the five years since the release of the game? What tools are in my social software toolbox today that might have helped with the design?</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from F2F Facilitation</em></strong> -- There are many skilled practitioners of face-to-face facilitation, some of which are paid very high fees for their skills. What lessons can we learn from their experience that we can apply to social software? Why have so many of these facilitators failed to have success online?</p>

<p><strong><em>More Human vs More Than Human</em></strong> -- Many futurists seek to offer us augmentation of our minds and bodies through technology. Many of these ideas may fundamentally change what it is to be human, and may even have unforeseen complications unanticipated by their creators. One interesting approach to looking at these technologies is to examine which make us "more human", rather then "more than human".</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Mental Disorders</em></strong> -- Most, if not all, mental disorders have their roots in survival strategies; however, they are over-expressed because of genetic or other causes. Examining the healthy behaviors hiding behind depression, autism, mania, schizophrenia, paranoia, etc. offer a number of insights on how we think.</p>

<p><strong><em>Joy of being a Primate</em></strong> -- If you scan the surface of my writing, you may observe that I have a strong belief that our animal nature and genetics form an essential and often unconscious part of what it is to be human. You could interpret these "nature" over "nurture" ideas as limiting us to being just animals. Instead, I believe that by becoming aware of our primate nature, and choosing to leverage it or suppress it by conscious choice rather then letting it drive us unaware, is what makes us more powerful.</p>

<p><strong><em>Smart Contracts</em></strong> -- Nick Szabo popularized the idea of using some of the primitives of cryptography in unique ways to create what he calls "smart contracts". He hypothesized approaches to cryptographic handling of collateral, bonding, delineation of property, bearer certificates, and much more. Others have proposed various auction protocols using these concepts. One of the fundamental atomic elements of many of these smart contracts is something called a "reusable proof of work", which Hal Finney recently demoed a version of at CodeCon 2005. What are the possibilities offered by smart contracts? What are the barriers to implementation?</p>

<p><strong><em>Club System</em></strong> -- In the 80's, development of Ted Nelson's Xanadu vision was being financed by Autodesk. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons Xanadu failed to deliver any technology. However, a couple of their ideas could be valuable today, one of which is the concept of an alternative to the "user and groups" metaphor for computer security. Xanadu turned that idea upside down and called the result the "club system". The club system approach is particularly suited to the internet based collaboration tools, in particular wikis. I also have some insights to offer a cryptographic approach to the club system, which might allow P2P distribution of collaborative documents, while preserving group privileges.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edges of Cryptographic Security</em></strong> -- The SSL cryptographic protocol offers a choice of a number of security properties: integrity, confidentiality, encryption, one-party authentication, and two-party authentication. But there are a number of security properties that very few deployed cryptographic protocols offer. These include perfect forward secrecy, undeniability, deniability, authorization, delegation, multi-party authentication, shared secrets, etc. What are these security properties and how are they useful? Why have they not been successfully broadly deployed?</p>

<p><strong><em>The SSL Story</em></strong> -- When SSL was first proposed it was broken within an hour. Even when Netscape fixed those problems, it wasn't clear that SSL was going to win the battle of security protocols. SSL was competing against SHTTP which had backing of RSA and an industry consortium. The credit card companies merged their standards and were backing SET. The internet community was moving toward SSH. Microsoft was doing its own embrace and extend protocol PCT. So how did SSL win to become the broadest deployed cryptographic security protocol? The answers may surprise you.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>As a former Macintosh developer, I've always been disappointed with the user-interface of web pages. The state of the art of UI design moved backwards with the advent of the browser -- we traded connectivity for ease-of-use. With the advent of pages written in Flash, some better user-interfaces were created, but at the important cost of things like being able to copy text, have semantic and meta-data information imbedded in web pages, searchability, etc.</p>

<p>So I keep an eye out for innovative ideas that preserve the essence of what is so powerful about web pages, yet also offer a good ideas. My posts on <a href=../../../2004/10/map_mashup.html>Map Mashup</a> and <a href=../../../2004/09/tiddlywiki.html>TiddlyWiki</a> offer some interesting web UI exemplars.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;complete=1"><img src=../../../images/logo_google_suggest.gif alt=Logo_google_suggest height=79 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Logo_google_suggest></a></p>

<p>To this list of exemplars I now add <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;complete=1">Google Suggest</a> by Google programmer <a href=http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/12/ive-got-suggestion.html>Kevin Gibbs</a>, who wrote this as part of Google employee's ability to work 20% of the time on their own projects.

Google Suggest replaces the browser's default auto-complete with one specific to Google searching. As you type each letter of your search request, you are shown the most popular requests for that term, and how many search hits are available for that search term. You really have to try out to understand how amazing and intuitive it is.</p>

<p>Blogger <a href=http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/>Chris Justus</a> has <a href=http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/2004/12/google-suggest-dissected.html>dissected and documented</a> how Google Suggest works. If you are a web developer, I recommend you read his analysis and I hope it will inspire you.</p>

<p>This specific technique is probably not useful for all web sites -- the amount of load that even a small number of users can place on a database using this technique requires a large server infrastructure, as basically every time you type a letter a database is being hit. Google can do this as they understand server farms and how to scale large loads. However, as inspiration for other ideas, I think it is marvelous.</p>

<p>For instance, I didn't know you could take control over your browsers auto-complete functionality by setting autocomplete="off" in your input field. Given this and the other techniques for display and cursor control, you could create dynamic auto-complete functionality on your own web pages, but skip the bandwidth intensive XMLHttpRequest by either caching the data in your web page, or in a user's cookie, or both. An example of this is <a href=http://blog.bitflux.ch/>BitFlux</a> blog's <a href=http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/livesearch_roundup.html>LiveSearch</a> functionality (which is also documented <a href=http://blog4.bitflux.ch/wiki/LiveSearch>here</a>).</p>

<p>The technique for retrieving the data using XMLHttpRequest is also marvelous. This functionality has been <a href=http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html>around for a while</a> but this is one of the cleanest examples of how to do it on the client side.</p>

<p>I've got some other ideas on how to apply some of these techniques to Wiki pages -- hopefully in the next few months I'll have some proof-of-concept examples for you to play around with.</p>

<p>In addition, Google Suggest is now, in a sense, a new web service from google that can be used independently. For instance Adam Stiles has <a href=http://www.adamstiles.com/adam/2004/12/hacking_google_.html>written</a> about a <a href=http://www.netcaptor.net/adsense/suggest.php>hack</a> to help suggest keywords for AdSense.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=http://www.jotspot.com/about/index.php>Joe Kraus</a>, one of the co-founders of Excite, and new <a href=http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/>blogger</a> has long been <a href=http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/wiki_and_then_s.html>rumored</a> to be working on a new wiki tool. Today at the <a href=http://www.web2con.com/pub/w/32/program.html>Web 2.0</a> conference Joe finally unveiled <a href=http://www.jotspot.com>JotSpot</a>, a new type of wiki that they have named an "Application Wiki". JotSpot appears to be not only an advanced wiki, but it also moves the predominantly text-based wiki toward being able to handle structured data and web application development.</p>

<p><img border=0 src=http://www.jotspot.com/tours/advanced/img/slide09.jpg style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;">At the JotSpot website there is an page on <a href=http://jot.com/compare/index.php>How JotSpot is Different</a> and an <a href=http://jot.com/tours/advanced/1.php>Advanced Tour</a> of this wiki's database capabilities.</p>

<p>Better, however, is a demonstration that Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer gave InfoWorld reporter <a href=http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/06.html#a1090>Jon Udell</a> an early <a href=http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/jot.swf>demo of JotSpot</a>, which Jon screen-captured and has released as a 23-minute, 32MB Flash presentation. This demo is very impressive: in addition to incremental improvements to wiki, such as WYSIWYG editing, email support, indexed attachments, RSS and web page importing, etc.  Kraus and Spencer also demonstrate a very powerful forms templating interface that is very much like creating HTML forms with Javascript, and demonstrated integration with a <a href=http://www.salesforce.com>SalesForce.com</a> web application using SOAP. It appears that JotSpot leverages the unstructured and adhoc advantages that are a strength of wiki, yet allows structure to be added later such that the data in the wiki can be integrated with other non-wiki applications.</p>

<p>The discussion during the demo is also very interesting. Jon Udell made an observation about JotSpot entering into Lotus Notes territory, and Kraus and Spencer discuss how JotSpot makes web application development more accessible, and expressed their desire to create a marketplace for small developers to create tools using JotSpot.</p>

<p>From what I've seen so far, JotSpot looks like it may the first of a third-generation of wikis, the first being the very simple wikis such as <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham>Ward Cunningham's</a> <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki>C2 Wiki</a>, and second generation being database-backed wikis such as <a href=http://www.wikipedia.com>Wikipedia</a> and <a href=http://www.socialtext.com>SocialText</a>. If you are serious about wiki, I highly recommend you take a look at this demo.</p>

<p>Joe Kraus also announced today that they have received a $5.2M funding round from <a href=http://www.redpoint.com>Redpoint</a> and <a href=http://mayfield.com>Mayfield</a>, both top VC firms.</p>

<p>MultiMap is a company that sells maps and aerial photos, primarily for Great Britain. They offer an online map tool that is very similar to that used by MapQuest or Yahoo Maps.</p>

<p>However, for certain regions, they have this fabulous capability to show you the aerial photo of the place, then display hovering around the cursor a slightly transparent map. For instance, take a look at this map of <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/photo.cgi?client=public&amp;X=533258&amp;Y=180057&amp;width=500&amp;height=310&amp;gride=529090&amp;gridn=179645&amp;srec=0&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;db=pc&amp;pc=&amp;zm=0&amp;scale=10000&amp;up.x=186&amp;up.y=3">the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>This trick is done completely in Javascript, located in <a href=http://www.multimap.com/static/global.js>global.js</a>, and uses the overlay.style.* properties that I've really only seen used in Javascript-based menus before. I'm a bit confused on how this works in IE, as it does not support alpha tranparency as this posting <a href=http://persistent.info/archives/2004/04/27/overlays>semi-transparent image overlays</a> discusses, but I suspect they accomplished it through careful use of transparency in the .gif overlay image. I'll have to investigate more.</p>

<p>There are probably many more other innovative uses of this type of transparency overlay tracking to the cursor that can be helpful in other web tools.</p>

<p>The key feature of TiddlyWiki is that instead of <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiName>WikiName</a> links leading to new pages, it displays a new set of <a href="http://www.cmswiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=MicroContent">microcontent</a> at the top of the current page, pushing your previous content toward the bottom of the page. Thus your link history is all on a single page rather then through your browser's back button. You really need to try it out to understand it.</p>

<p>In its current form, TiddlyWiki is still really more a technology demonstration than a useful tool, as you can't save the changes you make. However, there are people that are creating a <a href=http://www.patrickcurry.com/tiddly/>PHP TiddlyWink</a> based on it.</p>

<p>There are a number of things about TiddlyWiki that interest me. One is that it is more microcontent focused, rather then page focused. I've seen a few attempts to do blogs in Wikis and to date I have been unsatisfied -- part of the reason is that most blogs consist primarily of a chronological series of microcontent, whereas Wikis tend to be more oriented around pages. The ideas in TiddlyWiki may offer an alternative.</p>

<p>Another unique aspect of TiddlyWiki is its approach to link history. I'm not sure if new microcontent should appear at the top, as it does in TiddlyWiki, or at the bottom, but it certainly is an useful experiment.</p>

<p>TiddlyWiki also seems to also be an interesting way to create hypertext stories -- see for instance see the interactive fiction <a href=http://scribbling.net/projects/tiddlywiki/BabyDogSitter.html>Baby Dog Sitter</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I see TiddlyWiki as an encouragement to other Wiki designers to see what can be done with client-side Javascripts. One of the reasons that <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> feels so responsive is due to its use of Javascript, and <a href=http://www.oddpost.com>OddPost</a> does some amazing things emulating the Outlook mail client exclusively using Javascript inside a web page. <a href=http://www.flexwiki.com>FlexWiki</a> is one of the few other Wikis that use Javascript in novel ways; however, they are Microsoft-centric rather than standards-centric, so I've heard that some of their features don't work on Mozilla-family browsers. I'd like to see more experimentation combining Javascript and Wiki.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing what shakes out as this tool matures.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I believe that as we evolve social software to better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in, we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work.</p>

<p>One useful concept I use I call "Progressive Trust". The basic idea is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, rather then solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust.</p>

<p>This is how I typically explain progressive trust when I meet someone in-person at a conference:</p>

<p>You are now spending your most precious resource, that most unrenewable commodity -- time, in order to listen and understand what I have to say.</p>

<p>Why do you do so? Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me--that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well. In turn, I'm willing to spend more time chatting with you for the same reason.</p>

<p>Why do we continue to chat, and not move on to other people to discuss with? Because as we chat we are exchanging a number of credentials -- people we know in common, common interests, meaningful ideas, etc. We may also present credentials typically issued by others, like our business cards, or explain our relationship to the host.</p>

<p>As our unspoken agreement to continue discussion evolves, we typically will unconsciously check to see if others are listening, and adapt our conversation thereafter. If the discussion becomes more personal or serious, we will often find ourselves moving to a more private portion of the room. As our discussions become deeper, we may begin to speak of things that hint at a mutual respect for confidentiality.</p>

<p>Also early on we'll begin to scope out the nature of our time together. Is it only professional, or a potential friendship? Even intimate relationships go through this phase -- are we with someone who wants to date? Is is possible that a future date lead to something more?</p>

<p>If we agree to meet later to discuss more, before we meet again we may go authenticate some of the credentials given us. We'll not authenticate all of them, only enough to substantiate the level of assurance that we need for the risk we are taking (which may only be the future loss due to wasted time, but even that is a form of risk.) This authentication can consist simply of confirming information given, or it can be as complex as asking for an endorsement from a mutual colleague.</p>

<p>As our collaboration grows, we will find ourselves seeking more and more credentials, endorsements, etc., but they will not be enough. The next level of trust can only be established by experience of commitment -- for instance do we call back when we said we would? These tests typically start with small things, and then grow to larger things. At some point this may ultimately grow to form simple verbal contracts; over time richer, deeper social contracts are agreed upon that might not be written down.</p>

<p>Ultimately we may bring in third parties to witness, and thus possibly enforce our mutual obligations, whether it is just having a mutual colleague view our handshake or friends see us kiss, or whether it is having a legal, signed document.</p>

<p>At some point our mutual interests may be so large that we decide not just to collaborate, but to share assets, whether through a partnership, a corporation, or a marriage. Before this is complete there will be more credentials and authentication of those credentials (talk to former employees, engage in credit checks, visit each others' families, take blood tests), endorsements, and less risky tests of the full contract (signing a term sheet, or a marriage engagement).</p>

<p>This is the way human trust works. It also very similar to the way that groups work -- a corporation will collaborate with another corporation in the same way, starting with small trust, going on to tests, and leading ultimately up to partnerships and mergers.</p>

<p>Computer trust rarely works the way that human trust does. It starts with mathematical proofs--that such and such a mathematical algorithm is extremely difficult, thus something built on it must also be difficult. These are then built on top of each other until a system is created. It often seeks a level of "perfect trust" that is rarely required by human trust.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I chose to back the then nascent SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Standard back in 1992-3, was that I felt that it much better mapped to the progressive trust model, and thus to human trust, then did its competitors.</p>

<p>At the time, the SET standard was backed by all the major players--Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft, etc. However, it not only required strong mutual authentication, but it also require multiple authentications. HTTPS was backed by RSA, required digital signatures, preferably by both parties. SSL was not necessarily a clear winner.</p>

<p>But SSL starts out very simple--first it just connects two parties, then it establishes simple confidentiality between them. If one party wants more confidentiality, they can upgrade to a stronger algorithm. Then one party can request a credential from the other, or both can. Either party has the option to request authentication of those credentials. Ultimately you could use SSL to come close to the level trust that SET tried to establish, but SSL isn't generally used that way because the market decided that only one party needed to send a credential--the merchant. SSL also proved to be more flexible then for use just with web pages or credit cards -- now it is used for things like securing email, creating VPNs, and playing online games.</p>

<p>Thus progressive trust is a useful conceptual model for understanding how trust might be built using online tools. Look at the tools that you are using now -- do they support various levels of trust, and a natural path between them? Or is trust more binary -- someone is only trusted, or not trusted. Are there implicit levels of progressive trust that are part of the culture of your group that might not embodied in the software itself?</p>

<p>Progressive trust also maps well to an user-interface design technique called <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProgressiveDisclosure>Progressive Disclosure</a>. It sequences information and actions across several different windows in order not overwhelm the user. You disclose basic information and choices first, then revealing progressively more complex information and choices. Thus you help the user manage the complexity of the application. Navigating group interactions and culture is also complex, thus progressive trust allows you to hide some of initial complexity of the trust model behind your tools, and thus lower barriers of entry to your software.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I have been leading the design of a new Open Source collaboration tool called <a href=http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index.php>EditThisPagePHP</a><a>, which started </a><a href=../../../2003/12/editthispagephp.html>six months ago</a> and now is in beta.</p>

<p>My goal with EditThisPagePHP attempt to come close to <a href=http://www.scripting.com/>Dave Winer's</a> <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/discuss/msgReader$641?mode=topic">visionary statement</a> back in May of 1999:</p>

<blockquote><i>When I'm writing for the web, and I'm browsing my own site, every bit of text that I create has a button that says Edit This Page when I view it. When I click the button, a new page opens with the text in an HTML textarea. I edit. Click on Submit. The original page displays with the change. Three easy steps. The essential element is that *every* bit of text has this button. There can be no exceptions.</i></blockquote>

<p>At the fundamental level, EditThisPagePHP basically just let you remotely edit a single page. There are many situations where existing Wiki or Blog software is too complicated, or imposes too much structure. EditThisPagePHP lets you have total control over the HTML -- you can use sophisticated CSS layouts, or very simple HTML -- the software does not get in the way.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this simplicity, EditThisPagePHP also uses ideas drawn from various Wiki, Blog, and CMS (content management system) technologies. Like Wikis, it supports an edit-this-page button, page history, page diffs, and can email users when pages change. Like Blogs, it supports optional user comments, trackbacks (both send and receive), and delivers two RSS feeds -- one for the current version of the page, and one with diffs. Like a CMS, it supports multiple roles, by default a reader, an editor, and a super-editor -- each with different privileges.</p>

<p>I personally plan to use it for standards documents, lists, game rules, and home pages for various groups I collaborate with. I expect that others will use it anytime a group of people want to maintain a publicly accessible page together.</p>

<p>Some screenshots:</p>

<p><b>Technical Details:</b> EditThisPagePHP is written solely in PHP, and it currently works with PHP 4 and 5, and does not require SQL. Every revision makes a backup of itself, so no data can be lost. PHP is not allowed in the HTML text itself, to minimize security risks. Only two files are required: the core PHP script (editthispage.php) and a data file for your page. The core file can support as many pages as desired. The current version is <a href=http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/editthispagephp/editthispage-0.5b2.zip?download>0.5b2</a>, is licensed under a BSD-style license, and there is a <a href=http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/demo_05b2/index.php>working sandbox demo</a> available to play with.</p>

<p>Future goals are to support more technical features, without losing the elegance and simplicity of the implementation. This may include limited Wiki TextFormatting or a simple WYSIWYG editor, HTML-tidy, some user-interface enhancements, etc. A complete list is available on our <a href=http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/wishlist.php>wishlist</a> page.</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I've not just been spending time looking at social networking services, I've also been digging deeper into wiki. I've still got more to go, but some of these will be of interest to you if you are considering implementing a wiki for your community, or if you are a wiki developer.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.zwiki.org>Zwiki</a> is based on Zope, and thus has a very interesting feature set. One of the more popular features is the topic mappings that it creates. When combined with the CMS features of Plone, it becomes even more interesting -- one of the best Zwiki/Plone communities to look at as an example is <a href=http://doc.hydrogenaudio.org/wikis/hydrogenaudio/FrontPage>Hurricane Audio</a>. Unfortunately Zwiki only works on the Zope web platform, which is not as popular as Apache.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.flexwiki.com>FlexWiki</a> is a very innovative wiki that is being developed by some Microsoft engineers and is ASP.NET based for Windows. I in particular like the <a href=http://flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.ExamplePropertyPage>property page features</a> which are an elegant way to handle meta-data, and also how it handles diffs.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.projectforum.com>ProjectForum</a> and <a href=http://www.courseforum.com>courseforum</a> are both fairly simple but elegant commercially supported wiki. Of particular note is that both are very easy to install, even on a Windows 2000 system or Macintosh, as well as on Linux. I was able to get a test ProjectForum up on my Windows PC in about 5 minutes, including downloading. It also has some nice "skins" available. I also like how private areas are created for each -- this is the basic difference between the two products, and a rare wiki feature.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/>WikidPad</a> is interesting because it is not a public service, but a shareware single-user "notepad" for Windows that supports wiki-style TextFormattingRules and WikiWords. If you have been using wiki a lot like I have, sometimes you catch yourself using wiki-style text everywhere, and I guess this product is for people who do that like me.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.socialtext.com>SocialText</a> is another commercially supported wiki, but is sold as a service not a product. They are very carefully added features while keeping things elegant and simple for less sophisticated business customers. They also host a number of public wikis, so if you want to see the current feature set see <a href=http://http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest>RSS-Winterfest</a> which also shows off their newest RSS support.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.seedwiki.com>SeedWiki</a> is another wiki service rather then product (sometimes called a WikiFarm), and is interesting because it doesn't use Wiki style TextFormattingRules -- instead, it has several WYSIWYG editors that allow you to directly edit the underlying HTML. This gives a huge amount of flexibility for some of the communities that use it, such as <a href="http://www.seedwiki.com/page.cfm?doc=WikiFish&amp;wikiid=1231">WikiFish</a>.</p>

<p>I also have heard good things about PHPWiki and MoinMoin, but I haven't had a chance to dig into those very much yet.</p>

<p>I personally have been using <a href=http://www.twiki.org>TWiki</a> for 4+ years at several of my businesses. Its strength is that it is oriented toward allowing private groups who can manage their own access privileges. It also has one of the most active 'plugins' developer areas with lots of ways to modify your TWiki to do different things (one of the plugins I'm investigating now is <a href="//http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/EvEm>EvEm</a>). My only complaints are that TWiki is rather hard to install, and that the default skin isn't very elegant (I recommend the <a href=">GnuSkin</a>, but read the docs very carefully as you have to chmod a module if you install it.)</p>

<p>Although it uses a fairly primitive wiki, I highly recommend the <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki>Meatball Wiki</a> site for people very interested in wikis. It is a meta-wiki discussion community. It has some great pages on the life-cycle of wikis, on various design patterns and features of wikis, and of various other consequences of the medium. If you look at <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?back=CategoryWikiEngine">CategoryWikiEngine</a> it has one of the more complete lists of Wiki engines out there.</p>

<p>I will be reporting more on various wikis and wiki technology that I discover in the upcoming weeks.</p>
