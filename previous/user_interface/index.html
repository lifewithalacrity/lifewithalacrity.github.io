                                <p>Between the business of the March/April conference season and leaving Blackphone, I've run out of business cards. Rather than rush to print a bunch of new ones, I'm created this mini-resume for digital sharing and a two-sided Avery business card version that I am printing on my laser printer and sharing.</p>
<p>Not as pretty as my old Life With Alacrity cards, but effective in getting across the diversity of my professional experience and interests.</p>

<p>As someone who teaches Personal Branding in my courses at BGI@Pinchot.edu, I always find it hard to practice as I preach to ask for advice and suggestions. In this case I'm trying to tame my three-headed Cerebus of a profession with Privacy/Crypto/Developer Community, an Innovative Business Educator/Instructional Designer head, and my Collaborative Tools, Processes, Games and Play head. All come tied together in my body as ultimately being about collaboration, but it is hard to explain some of the correspondences.</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563798/ title="Trust Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3055563798_5355b9b99c_m.jpg alt="Trust Circle" height=160 width=240 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>With Google+ almost two weeks into its test phase, conversation about this new social network service seems to be going in circles.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>That’s because Circles is the Google+ feature that users are generating the most buzz about. It’s Google’s answer to the problem of organizing your social graph online.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph>social graph</a> it’s a map of everyone you know and how they are related to you. Social graphs are tricky; as you try to define them you’ll inevitably run into some complications.</p>
<p>Pete Pachal, news director of <a href=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2387808,00.asp>@PCMag</a> comments:</p>
<blockquote><em>“People want things easy, and Google Circles isn’t easy. It puts the burden on users to take the time to think about each and every contact and put them in a specific bucket. To use the feature effectively, users will certainly have to create new Circles, and that requires even more thought. After using Google+ for a few minutes last night, I was often unsure which Circles to put certain people in and, more to the point, which to leave them out of. And what if you create a new Circle that should include some of the people in other Circles you already have?”</em></blockquote>
<p>Circles are lists that you’ve created by grouping people together and giving them a name. They’re important in Google+ because when you post you must explicitly say which “Circles” you wish to share with. Posting to a limited list of people is a big change from existing social networks such as Facebook, where posts are sent to all mutual friends by default, or Twitter, where posts are public. This change forces you to think more deeply about your social graph and who should see each item you post.</p>
<p><iframe src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/BwvygI2xKGM height=349 width=560 frameborder=0></iframe></p>
<h2 id=yourinitialsetofcircles>Your Initial Set of Circles</h2>
<p>Google+ will present you with 4 suggested set of Circles: Friends, Family, Acquaintances, and Following.</p>
<p><a href=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d-pi style="display: inline;"><img border=0 src=../.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d-800wi alt=Default-google+-circles title=Default-google+-circles class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d image-full"></a> <br>Google+ also defines five special Circles: Two are only for reading: "Stream" which is everyone in any of your Circles; and "Incoming" which is are posts that are shared to you by people not in your Circles. Then are three special Circles managed by Google only for posting: "Your Circles" which is everyone in any of your Circles; “Extended” which is everyone in your Circles plus the people in <em>their</em> Circles; and “Public” which is <em>anyone</em>.</p>
<p>Few find this default set to be sufficient. As a result, most Google+ users are soon creating new Circles, moving people around, renaming Circles, etc.</p>
<p>There are sound reasons for people finding the default Circles limiting. Sociological research shows that everyone has a number of concentric personal circles (see my blog post <a href=../2008/11/personal-circle.html>Community by the Numbers, Part II: Personal Circles</a> for more details). These circles are sometimes called “ego-centric” social graphs as the individual is located in the center. This sort of graph is the model I used when I began reorganizing my own Google+ Circles.</p>
<p>I started out using Support (for my Support Circle), Close (for my Sympathy Circle), Trusted (for my Trust Circle), and Colleagues (for my Emotional Circle), but that didn’t work for very long. I’ve since been experimenting with a number of different ways to organize my Circles. I wanted an initial set that would offer useful early advice for using Google+ but would still be applicable for when expanded to hundreds of people. (I now have over 600 people in my Circles.)</p>
<p>One insight I’ve had is to avoid the word ‘friends’, which has been corrupted to almost meaninglessness in recent years. So instead I use terminology like Peers for my trust circle and Kith for the combination of my support and sympathy circles. (Kith may be familiar to you from the phrase “kith and kin”. The root of kith means “to know”, thus it’s those people that you know very well and that know you very well.)</p>
<p>I also learned that sub-Circles exist within Circles. Using a ‘general ledger’ system of naming Circles with numbers—which I’ll demonstrate in a moment—helps me keep these Circles and sub-Circles in order and allows me to easily add new Circles when I need to. Hopefully Google+ will in the future introduce features that allow us to order Circles as we please, but until then this numbering system works.</p>
<p>Working with Google+ has also shown me that some Circles are for reading and other Circles are for posting. I’ll talk a little more about this below.</p>
<p>It has only been a week, but by combining these insights to organize my Circles I’ve improved my ease of use and become better able to manage my time while using Google+.</p>
<p>Here is my recommended initial list of Circles:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>0.0 ME</strong> - a simple Circle with just yourself in it, for saving posts, for drafts, etc.<br><strong>1.0 KIN</strong> - your family &amp; extended family<br> <strong> 2.0 KITH</strong> - your best friends, your confidants (i.e. those with whom one shares a secret or private matter, trusting them not to repeat it to others)<br><strong> 3.0 PEERS</strong> - your trusted colleagues, those who you work closely with, your collaborators<br><strong> 4.0 LOCAL</strong> - your neighbors, parents of your children's friends, people you'd invite to a party<br><strong> 5.0</strong> {various groups &amp; interests}<br><strong> 6.0 ACQUAINTANCES</strong> - people you know, but that you don't know well or that don’t know you well<br><strong> 7.0 FOLLOWS ME</strong> - people who follow you on Google+, who you may or may not know<br><strong> 8.0 WATCHING</strong> - people whose posts you read, but who don't necessarily read your posts<br><strong> 9.0 SPECIAL</strong> - useful for special lists &amp; exceptions</p>
<h2 id=expandingcircles>Expanding Circles</h2>
<p>Many people will find my default set of ~10 Circles to be very useful, and need only add a few more. However, the design of this set is to allow for much greater expansion should you need it.</p>
<p>Like those “personal circles” that I wrote about previously, most of the Circles above are ego-centric: they’re fundamentally centered on your own personal social graph. This isn’t the only potential type of Circle, however. Socio-centric Circles aren’t centered on you, though they still have some sort of membership boundaries, while info-centric Circles are based on topics instead of being based on relationships. These socio-centric and info-centric Circles will support many relationships better than ego-centric Circles do.</p>
<p>If someone seems to write a lot about a particular topic, I put him or her into an appropriate info-centric Circle. My own info-centric Circles thus include people who post about topics like iOS Development, the Social Web, Sustainability/Green, and Entrepreneuring. If a number of people are all part of a group or all come from a certain geographical area then I put them together in a socio-centric circle. After creating the Circles, I put the ones that were geographic into 4.0 of my ledger, then placed the others in 5.0. (I tried separating out groups and interests, and found that didn’t work, so now I keep them together.)</p>
<p>I now have over 600 people in my Google Plus+ social graph. All together my Circles now look something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>0.0 Read Later<br> 0.1 Drafts<br> 0.2 Book Project<br> 0.3 iPad Project<br><br> 1.0 ALL KIN<br> 1.1 Immediate Family<br> 1.2 Extended Family<br><br> 2.0 ALL KITH<br> 2.1 Close Friends<br> 2.2 Old But Distant Friends<br> 2.3 Distant Family<br><br> 3.0 ALL PEERS<br> 3.2 Collaborators<br> 3.3 Current Professional Colleagues<br> 3.4 Former Professional Colleagues<br><br> 4.0 ALL LOCAL<br> 4.1 Local Kith, Kin &amp; Peers<br> 4.2 Local Berkeley<br> 4.3 Non-Local Seattle<br> 4.3 Non-Local Portland<br><br> 5.0 ALL GROUPS &amp; INTERESTS<br> 5.1 Entrepreneurs<br> 5.2 Apple &amp; iOS<br> 5.3 - iOSDevCamp<br> 5.4 Green &amp; Sustainability<br> 5.5 - BGIedu<br> 5.6 Social Web<br> 5.7 - Jerry’s Kids<br><br> 6.0 ACQUAINTANCES<br> 6.1 Familiar Strangers<br> 6.2 Friendly Strangers<br><br> 7.0 FOLLOWS ME<br> 7.1 Core Audience<br> 7.2 Commented or Shared My Posts<br><br> 8.0 WATCHING<br> 8.2 Pundits<br> 8.3 Celebrities<br> 8.4 Noisy<br><br> 9.0 ALL<br> 9.1 Everyone But Pundits, Celebrities &amp; Noisy<br> 9.2 Read Daily<br> 9.3 Read Weekly</strong></p>
<p>In a future blog post I’ll share my ongoing experience with using this approach to Circles, but this example shows how easy it is to separate and add Circles as your interests change and grow.</p>
<h1 id=managingyourcircles>Managing Your Circles</h1>
<p>We, as humans, enjoy social networks in large part because we get to interact with people. Managing your Circles is thus about more than just understanding your social graph. It also allows you to manage your time effectively when you read and share with other people on Google+. Here is my approach for how to manage the time you spend reading, sharing, and managing your social graph.</p>
<h3 id=circlesforreading><strong>Circles for Reading</strong></h3>
<p>I find it useful to think about Circles that are explicitly for reading as different from Circles intended for sharing. I have a few of these read-only Circles. Thus, my “Pundits” Circle contains people that share a lot and for whom I don’t always want to read everything. My “Read Daily” Circle is conversely for people for whom I want to read everything they post.</p>
<p>I’ve also found Circles helpful for close collaborators. It’s easy in Google+ to have a conversation with someone directly by simply typing their name as +&lt;name&gt; into the share field of posts. However, I find these direct posts get lost over time. To resolve this problem, create a Circle dedicated to just the two of you: a dyad. I have a number of people that I’m collaborating with closely and I use these small Circles to both keep track of our mutual posts and to see what they are thinking about at the moment. Examples of this kind of two-person Circle include my “Book Project” and “iPad Project”</p>
<h3 id=timemanagementofreadingcircles><strong>Time Management of Reading Circles</strong></h3>
<p>Each day I look first at my “ALL KIN”, “ALL KITH” and and “ALL PEER” Circles to see what is going on with my support, sympathy and trust cliques. Then I’ll read my “Read Daily” Circles.</p>
<p>After reading these daily basics (which I try to keep to a limited number), I’ll typically pick an interest, a geography, or a group, depending on what I’m doing that day. (My personal time-management style is to only follow one interest per day, e.g. if I am working on my iPad app then I’m not reading Social Web posts.) If I’m preparing a blog post and want to see what my audience is thinking I might review “Core Audience”, or “FOLLOWS ME”. If I’m traveling I might read one of my non-local Circles such as “Seattle”. If I’m doing ‘weak-signal research’ I might start with “ALL INTERESTS”, but if I’m particularly tolerant of noise I might read “Familiar Strangers”, “FOLLOWS ME”, “Everyone but Pundits &amp; Strangers”, “Pundits”, or even “ALL”.</p>
<h2 id=postingtocircles>Posting to Circles</h2>
<p>One of the important reasons for creating Circles in the first place is so that you can share with groups of people. I’ve developed some strategies for this as well.</p>
<h3 id=circlesforposting:><strong>Circles for Posting</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve found it useful to create a Circle that only contains yourself. I have two of these — “Read Later”, and “Drafts”. If I’m reading and I see something interesting but don’t have time for it immediately, I’ll share it with my “Read Later” Circle so that I can quickly go back to it. Similarly, if I need to do some more research before writing and sharing, I’ll share my immediate thoughts in “Drafts”. As new features are added to Google+ these Circles will hopefully become obsolete, but they are useful for now.</p>
<h3 id=managingsharingprivacyofprivateposts><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Private Posts</strong></h3>
<p>When sharing, you want to ask yourself if this is ‘private’ post, a ‘quasi-public’ post or a ‘public’ post.</p>
<p>My private posts tend to go “KIN”, “KITH”, a dyad project, or one of the sub-Circles of PEER depending on their context. Some posts that are of only geographic interest (say a party, or local event) will be shared privately to the appropriate local Circle. If you are using my ledger system of using numbers in Circle names, these are the lower numbers—5.0 and below are Circles where I’m more sensitive about privacy.</p>
<p>Once shared, these more personal posts will be labeled as “Limited” instead of using the “Public” label that allows anyone to see them. If a recipient tries to share a “Limited” post, a box will pop up reminding the person: “This post was originally shared with a limited audience – remember to be thoughtful about who you share it with”. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, one purpose of Circles on Google+ is to determine who gets what information.</p>
<p>Though it may be easy to create Circles to segregate those with whom you wish to share private information, the recipients of your posts have no such limitations and could share outward beyond your intent (though they will be warned if they try to, as noted above). To enable further privacy you can disable resharing of these personal posts made to your Circles. To do so, share your post to a non-public Circle, then you select the arrow in the upper-right-hand corner where you can edit, delete or disable the post, and click on the final option, “Disable Reshare”.</p>
<p>There’s another privacy issue: by clicking the grey “Limited” label, a message’s recipient can see all others you shared the post with. This could potentially result in privacy problems, as the reader could discover who is in one of your Circles. There are ways of eliminating this by going into your Privacy account settings, which I will cover in a future post.</p>
<h3 id=managingsharingprivacyofquasi-publicposts><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Quasi-Public Posts</strong></h3>
<p>I call posts “quasi-public” when they’re of narrow interest to a specific group or a topic that isn’t really relevant to other members of my audience. I find these quasi-public posts happen the most for my more esoteric interests—for instance, when I’m sharing a complex iPhone development article that is really only interesting to a narrow group of my contacts.</p>
<p>In Google Reader, I typically wouldn’t share these articles at all because there were so many of my contacts that wouldn’t be interested in them and it would only be noise to them. Ditto with Twitter. I found that sometimes people would stop following me after a conference I attended because I posted regularly and the conference was not of interest to them. This could be quite frustrating at times. Though these posts were not private by any means, I only wanted to share them with a specific group, such as an iPhone group. Now with Circles, I can share this information easily with my “Apple &amp; iOS” Circle. I find that this feature is what makes Google+’s Circles so potentially powerful.</p>
<p>Though I might offer much of this more esoteric information as “quasi-public” posts to a specific group or interest, I’ll probably offer the best of them to the “Public”. Sometimes that is what it means to be a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven>Maven</a>—you share across social network boundaries.</p>
<h3 id=managingsharingprivacyofpublicposts><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Public Posts</strong></h3>
<p>Sharing a post to your “Your Circles” is effectively public, as is sharing to “Extended Circles”. Ask yourself if there is really some reason why you don’t want to make a post totally “Public” so that it is searchable by those who are not members of Google+. If there is some reason, consider sharing to your “ALL” Circle or some other more limited circle instead, as you’ll have more control and can turn off resharing or commenting.</p>
<h2 id=managingyoursocialgraph>Managing Your Social Graph</h2>
<p>Maintaining your Circles can take away from the time you can spend on reading and sharing. I’ve come up with the following strategy to limit the time I spend.</p>
<p>To start with, I have some basic rules for which Circles to place people in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I’m notified that someone is following me, I add them to “FOLLOWS ME” and an appropriate other Circle. If I vaguely recognize a follower’s name or face, I put them in “Familiar Strangers”. If I don’t recognize them at all but they look interesting, I add them to “Friendly Strangers”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I’m notified that someone has +1’ed, commented, or mentioned me in a post, I add them to “Core Audience” and the appropriate sub-Circle. I will also make sure that the other Circles they are in are correct.</p>

<p>If I discover while I’m reading that someone is too noisy for the Circle I selected, I’ll move them to a more appropriate Circle—or place them in the “Noisy” Circle or even block them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=timemanagementofyoursocialgraph><strong>Time Management of Your Social Graph</strong></h3>
<p>In addition I review a few of my Circles every day. I do so by going to “Manage Circles”, then selecting “People in your Circles” and sorting by last name. I choose that letter of the alphabet that corresponds to the day of the month and hover my mouse over each name. (For example, I look at names starting with “L” on July 12th, as “L” is the 12th letter.) Google+ highlights the Circles that each person is in. If they’re in the wrong Circle, I move them. I might even click on some people and review their profile so that I can see who they are—or (if I already know them) see what they are up to lately, update my address book, and maybe send them a brief email. At the end of the month (on the 27th through the 31st) I review my overall Circles lists. This way, over the course of each month I briefly review my entire social network, without spending too much time on it. (I try to spend 10 minutes or so a day.)</p>
<p>Periodically (right now weekly, but hopefully eventually monthly) I do some larger scale management of my Circles. Learning how to do this the first time is a pain, but once you know how it only takes a few minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I go to “Manage Circles” and select “People Who Have Added You”. I sort that list by “Not Yet in Circles”, “Select All” and add the people revealed to “FOLLOWS ME”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I then do the same with all of my Circles to update my “ALL” Circle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I copy my “ALL” circle to “Everyone But Pundits, Celebrities &amp; Noisy” and remove any Pundits, Celebrities or Noisy people from that Circle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When managing your Circles, remember the motto “Perfection is the Enemy of the Good”. You are the only one that sees who is in which Circle, and you can place people in multiple Circles. So your Circles don’t have to be perfect, just good enough. If you share a lot of private posts, concentrate on making sure that those more personal Circles are more accurate.</p>
<p>Using these approaches, you should find Circle management quick, and you won’t get mired down in Circle management for hours at a time.</p>
<h1 id=summary>Summary</h1>
<p>Looking back, I wish I had this organization when I started on Google+ two weeks ago. By using some of these techniques from the beginning I would have made my life a lot easier. Over the next month I now have to go back and re-organize people and re-Circle them. I hope sharing these tips will make your use of Google+ simpler from the start!</p>
<p>Also, I expect that Google will be adding new features to make Google+ easier. For instance I’m hoping for #hashtags (the ability to tag posts into topic categories), favorites (the ability to tag posts into a persistent archive, hopefully with an option tag), ordering Circles, concentric Circles, and better integration with Google Reader. (I share my favorite blog posts on <a href=http://www.google.com/reader/shared/ChristopherA target=_self>Google Reader</a> at  and my best of best articles and posts in <a href=http://twitter.com/ChristopherA/favorites target=_self>Twitter Favorites</a> or <a href=http://delicious.com/christophera target=_self>Delicious</a>.)</p>
<p>As with any new online feature, people are finding out new things and coming up with new ideas every day. So what are <em>your</em> methods for organizing your Circles and social graph?</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/atow/750701139/><img src=../images/2007/07/08/everyone.jpg alt=Everyone height=133 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Everyone></a> I feel privileged and honored to have been part of the <a href=http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp>iPhoneDevCamp</a> this last weekend. Over 380 iPhone developers came out to the Adobe Campus in San Francisco to help each other make the best possible web pages and webapps for the iPhone.</p>

<p>I was the keynote speaker on Saturday and Master of Ceremonies for the MacHack-style <a href=http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCampHackAThon>Hack-a-Thon Demo</a> on Sunday.</p>

<p>At the Hack-a-Thon almost 50 iPhone web applications were demonstrated to an enthusiastic audience. Take a look at <a href=http://www.xeodesign.com/tilt>Tilt</a>, a game that takes advantage of the iPhone's motion sensor, <a href=http://www.mxis.com/pickleview>PickleView</a>, which is a same-time live baseball game enhancer, and <a href=http://www.bartholo.com/devcamp/pool.html>The Pool</a>, an attractive social game of water droplets hitting a pool. What is remarkable about these applications is not just the quality, but that each of them was written over just the weekend by a small team of 3-4 people who hadn't met each other before Friday!</p>

<p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/snackfight/750214294/><img src=../images/2007/07/08/hewitt.jpg alt=Hewitt height=150 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border=0 width=200 title=Hewitt></a> Prizes were awarded after the Hack-a-Thon based on the spirit of openness, contribution, sharing, and participation. Prizes included 3 iPhones and some very expensive Adobe software. In particular <a href=http://www.joehewitt.com/>Joe Hewitt</a>, of <a href=http://www.getfirebug.com/>Firebug</a> fame, was honored for his positive contributions, generous spirit, and wonderful iPhone UI <a href=http://www.joehewitt.com/files/iphone/navigation.html>example code</a>. During the demonstrations, more than one person praised Joe, saying that his assistance, his code, or his debugger made their apps possible. Personally, I think about one-third of the web apps presented used some of his code.</p>

<p>Building on my experience with the same-time collaboration tool <a href=http://www.synchroedit.com>SynchroEdit</a>, and the <a href=http://www.skotos.net>Skotos</a> web-based games, I worked remotely with <a href=http://www.kallealm.com/>Kalle</a> from Sweden and <a href=http://is-here.com/>Erwin</a> from Kansas to present an AJAX chat application called <a href=http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/>iLace</a>. I am particularly proud of how well this little web application performs and how well it works using the iPhone UI. In particular, I think its melding of text entry and chat message receipt and its response to changes between portrait and landscape modes are very good examples of what can be done for chat on the iPhone. Source code is <a href=http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/about.html>available</a>!</p>

<p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/atow/749665338/><img src=../images/2007/07/08/keynote.jpg alt=Keynote height=133 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Keynote></a> My keynote presentation slides are now available in <a href=http://iphonedevcamp.org/stuff/iPhoneDevCamp_Keynote.pdf>.pdf</a> and <a href=http://iphonedevcamp.org/stuff/iPhoneDevCamp_Keynote.mov>.mov</a>. I'm told a live recording of the session and an .mp3 will be available soon.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks an online developer community that I started at WWDC called <a href=http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com>iPhoneWebDev</a> has grown to over 650 members. It's now the best place to get online support for building iPhone web pages and webapps. I'd like to keep the momentum from the iPhoneDevCamp going forward on this list, so if you are interested in developing for the iPhone, check out the <a href=http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com/examples>example code</a> and <a href=http://www.iphonewebdev.com/>join</a> the discussion today!</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p><a href=http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/ad4/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/2007/06/15/watereddown.jpg alt=Watereddown title=Watereddown style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
I've been excited about the web capabilities of the upcoming <a href=http://www.apple.com/iphone/>iPhone</a> for some time. As a reluctant laptop user ("oh, my aching shoulders"), there is real appeal to me in a better portable web browser. I have tried most of the PDA and cellphone browsers to date, and none offer more then a poor cousin to the web that we experience on the desktop.</p>

<p>Instead, the iPhone offers a desktop-class browser. There is no transcoding, nor any subset of HTML such as <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language>WML</a>. Full web pages are rendered in the small display, and when you "double-tap" with your finger the section you touch is expanded to a more readable size. The <a href=http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/ad4/>video</a> available at the Apple website shows this capability in use.</p>

<p>Because of the iPhone's upcoming July 29th release, I decided to participate in this week's <a href=http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/>Apple WWDC</a> conference for Macintosh developers. There a number of announcements about the iPhone were released, and a number of technical sessions on the iPhone and iPhone-related technologies were held. Together the iPhone demonstrations at the public keynote and other demonstrations throughout the WWDC offered some real promise for when the phone is released on June 29th.</p>

<p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/15/iphonesteve.jpg onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=440,height=292,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/2007/06/15/iphonesteve.jpg alt=Iphonesteve height=132 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border=0 width=200 title=Iphonesteve></a>
The biggest announcement at the public <a href=http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/d7625zs/event/>keynote</a> was that there will not be an SDK for building native iPhone apps; instead, the only way for third parties to get involved is to create web applications optimized for the iPhone. This came as a big disappointment to the majority of developers participating at WWDC. However, as someone who has been involved lately in creating AJAX/Web 2.0 apps, I was less unhappy.</p>

<p>The other significant announcement at the keynote was that a <a href=http://www.apple.com/safari/download/>Safari 3.0 beta</a> for both Mac and Windows was being released and that a third Safari platform would be released on July 29th—inside the iPhone. This means that web 2.0 applications created to work with Safari on the Mac will likely also work on the iPhone.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.synchroedit.com><img border=0 src=http://www.synchroedit.com/img/selogo-nobox-green.png alt=SynchroEdit title=SynchroEdit style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>Since <a href=http://www.synchroedit.com>SynchroEdit</a>, an open-source simultaneous web editor (in the style of <a href=http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/>SubEthaEdit</a>) for Firefox that I produced last year, is one of the most sophisticated AJAX/Web 2.0 applications, I dug deeper at various WWDC sessions to see if it might be possible to make SynchroEdit work on the iPhone.</p>

<p>One of the biggest things that SynchroEdit needs in order to function is <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents>DOM Mutation Events</a>. At a party for <a href=http://www.webkit.org>WebKit</a> (the open source code underpinnings of Safari's web renderer) and in questions after a session at WWDC it was confirmed that these are available to Safari 3.0 and presumably the iPhone.</p>

<p>The other key ability that SynchroEdit requires is WYSIWYG editing. This was terribly broken in Safari 2.0, but I saw many demonstrations of it working in Safari 3.0, so I don't anticipate any problems with this.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit also requires AJAX and in particular the <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/>XMLHttpRequest</a> function, and the keynote clearly said that this was available.</p>

<p>The final thing that SynchroEdit needs is the ability to keep the browser at <em>readystate==3</em>, i.e. not "finish" sending the page, so that we can continue to interactively pass updates to users as they arrive, without creating a new connection for every message. It is not clear if this will be supported on the iPhone, but there are ways to work around it.</p>

<p>So, in principle, it appears that we should be able to make SynchoEdit work on the iPhone. I am not sure that many iPhone users need SynchroEdit, but as an example of a very sophisticated web technology that should work on that platform, it shows the potential for what might be possible.</p>

<p>Because of this technological capability I've decided to begin investigating what type of social software apps could be highly useful on the iPhone and that aren't being served by the existing web 2.0 community. I am also going to continue investigating the technical issues of developing web apps for the iPhone</p>

<p>If you are interested as well, I invite you to participate in the new <a href=http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com/>iPhoneWebDev</a> community. It should be a great resource for everyone interested in getting in on the ground floor with this new web technology. I have also begun tagging relevant web pages in <a href=http://del.icio.us/ChristopherA>del.icio.us</a> with the tag <a href=http://del.icio.us/tag/iphonewebdev>iphonewebdev</a>—I hope that others will begin to use this tag as well.</p>

<p>I have quite a bit more I'd like to write about specific iPhone technology, but unfortunately I have to wait until the <a href=http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/attendee/>WWDC confidentiality</a> expires on June 29th with the release of the iPhone, so keep an eye out here for more details.</p>

                                <p><span style="font-size: 0.7em;">by Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline</span></p>

<p><em>[This is the fourth in a series of articles on <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html>collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href=http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline>Shannon Appelcline</a>. It will be <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml>jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml>Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at <a href=http://www.skotos.net/>Skotos</a>.]</em></p>

<p>Last year in <a href=../2005/12/collective_choi.html>Collective Choice: Rating Systems</a> we took a careful look at eBay and other websites that collect ratings, and used those systems as examples to highlight a number of theories about how to make rating systems more useful.</p>

<p>We suggested three main methods for improving rating systems:</p>

<p><strong>Granular Ratings:</strong> Based on the clumping of ratings to high values, we believed that ratings could be made more useful by increasing the size of a rating scale. Most rating scales are 5-point ranges, so we suggested a 10-point range instead.</p>

<p><strong>Distinct Ratings:</strong> Raters can be somewhat arbitrary in how they rate items, varying both from each other and even from themselves (usually over multiple sessions). Thus we believed that providing explicit statements of what each number meant could improve ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Ratings:</strong> Finally we stated that in low volumes ratings could be biased by various quirks of data entry, either malevolent or not, and that ratings could be improved with strong statistical methods being used to polish up data and automatically keep "bad" data in line with "good".</p>

<p>In the year since we wrote that article we've decided to practice what we preach and have rolled out an entirely new rating system called <a href=http://index.rpg.net>The RPGnet Gaming Index</a>. We've applied all of the above theories and thus far it looks like they're not only working, but that they're actually providing better rating systems than previous ones we've used at the RPGnet site.</p>

<p>In this article we're going to step through the data we've collected from this experience and see how it applies to our theory: first by looking at our previous RPGnet rating system, then by looking at the new system, and finally by by examining the data from these two systems and comparing their results. We've also run into some unexpected troubles along the way, and we'll talk about that too.</p>

<h3>The RPGnet Reviews System</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.rpg.net><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/rpgnetlogo_1.gif alt=Rpgnetlogo_1 title=Rpgnetlogo_1 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"></a>
RPGnet is our gaming site for tabletop roleplaying—games like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>. We purchased it in 2001 from the original owners. One of the benefits of RPGnet was that it had a very large community. As of today it sports one of the top-100 forums on the Internet, with over 1000 simultaneous users regularly logging in. However, because of its maturity, we also inherited many existing systems.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9971.phtml><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/rpgnet_review_summary_1.jpg alt=Rpgnet_review_summary_1 title=Rpgnet_review_summary_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
One of these was the <a href=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/>RPGnet Reviews System</a> which gave individual users the ability to review gaming products—mostly role-playing games, but also board games, books, DVDs, and a smattering of related products.</p>

<p>Most of these reviews are submitted by average readers who just want to talk about a product that they like (or don't), though a fair percentage are instead submitted by staff reviewers. (Overall at least 26% of our reviews are based on publisher "comp" copies, and thus may be considered largely professional, while the other 74% may or may not be.) The large community size of RPGnet applies to the Reviews System as well: currently it features 8,505 published reviews.</p>

<p>Looking at the RPGnet Reviews through our three filters we find the following:</p>

<p><strong>Granularity.</strong> The ratings from our existing reviews aren't as granular as we'd like. We have a theoretical scale of 2-10, but that's based upon a Style rating of 1-5 and a Substance rating of 1-5.</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<thead>
<tr align=right>
<td><strong>Rating</strong></td>
<td><strong>Style</strong></td>
<td><strong>Substance</strong></td>
<td><strong>%</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr align=right>
<td>1</td>
<td>81</td>
<td>225</td>
<td>1.8%</td>

<tr align=right>

<td>42.0%</td>
</tr>

<tr align=right>
<td>5</td>
<td>1709</td>
<td>2326</td>
<td>23.7%</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p> Approximately 90% of raters rate only with values of 3-5, and thus our scale is more limited than the 2-10 range would indicate. 42.9% of reviews further rate Style and Substance exactly the same, suggesting that not everyone sees a difference between these two elements. On the whole this scale isn't as a bad as a singular 5-point scale, but it also isn't a real 10-point scale, and the two orthogonal types of comparison don't necessarily provide a coherent description of a product.</p>

<p><strong>Distinctiveness.</strong> Conversely, the review ratings are fairly distinct because the Review System provides an explanation of what each rating number means. For example the five Substance ratings are: I Wasted My Money (1); Sparse (2); Average (3); Meaty (4); Excellent(5). The descriptions could be better, but hopefully they connect to some users in meaningful ways, and help them to rate consistently.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Our review ratings have no statistical basis. These values are used entirely unfiltered.</p>

<p>On the whole, the existing RPGnet Reviews embodied slightly less than half of what we wanted to see in a rating systems: some improvement over a simple 5-point scale; some effort put into making individual ratings distinct; and nothing statistical.</p>

<p>There is room for improvement, however, as we'll see when we analyze this system more fully.</p>

<h3>The RPGnet Gaming Index</h3>

<p>Our newer system is the <a href=http://index.rpg.net/>RPGnet Gaming Index</a>. It doesn't supersede our Reviews, but instead offers a complementary look at the roleplaying field. The Index is essentially an RPG industry database. It contains individual entries for many different gamebooks—currently 5248—and allows registered users to rate each of them. Those ratings are then turned into averages by various mathematical formulas on a nightly basis and the roleplaying games in our index are then ranked.</p>

<p>The large size of RPGnet has allowed us to very quickly turn our ideas of a Gaming Index into reality. Just six months after release we have:</p>

<ul><li>5248 well-written Index entries </li>
<li> 5908 different editions</li>
<li> 4240 authors</li>
<li> 4478 covers</li>
<li> 360 different game systems</li>
<li> 345 series</li>
<li> 10142 individual ratings</ul>

<p>Most of the ratings are clumped around the best and worst games, with many less popular games unrated as of yet. Four different items have at least 80 ratings each (<em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, <em>Exalted</em>, <em>Nobilis</em>, and <em>Unknown Armies</em>). Our average rating is 6.79. Ratings above 7.82 are in the 99th
percentile, ratings above 7.21 are in the 90th percentile, and ratings
below 6.53 are beneath the 10th percentile.</p>

<p>(For more info on the creation of the RPG Index, and how to encourage user generated content, see Shannon's articles, "Managing User Creativity", <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_192.phtml>Part One</a> and <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_193.phtml>Part Two</a>.) </p>

<p>The RPGnet Index also handles some unusual situations, such as when a game book contains other game books as part of an anthology or compilation. For instance, the 8-book compilation <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=64">In Search of Adventure</a> has a composite rating of <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry-ratings.phtml?mainid=64">6.57</a> which is partially based upon the individual adventures that make it up.</p>

<p><strong>Granularity:</strong> The first thing we did was provide a 10-point scale for this new system.</p>

<p><strong>Distinctiveness:</strong> We also made sure each point of the scale was clearly defined. Currently the points of our scale are: Worthless (1), Poor (2), Some Flaws (3), Almost Average (4), Average (5), Above Average (6), Good (7), Very Good (8), Outstanding (9), and One of the Best Ever (10).</p>

<p>We made some mistakes in our original release of our "distinctive" titles, and we discovered this had real effects on the user input, telling us that these title labels <em>are</em> meaningful to users.</p>

<p>First, we initially labeled 6 as "average", to mirror the rating system for our existing Reviews, rather than setting 5 to be average. But as we noted in our first article, people like to be nice, and thus they tend to rate on the good side of a scale. Changing the label for our definition of average from 6 to 5 has slowly started dropping the average of all ratings down as a result (providing more breadth, a topic we'll talk about more shortly).</p>

<p>Second, two of our original distinctive titles were at odds with the others. Our original "2" value said that the game had "a few useful elements" and our original "9" value said that it was the "best of the year". The 2 was much more specific than any of our other terms and the 9 created a comparative query that was very different from anything else. Overall our ratings conformed to a bell curve centered between 6 and 7, but we saw very clear dropouts in our curve at 2 and 9, telling us that we'd made mistakes in those terms, and that people were less willing to use them as a result. Since we've made the change to our current set of titles those two discontinuities have disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Finally, we fully integrated statistics into our new Index by using two main methods: bayesian weights and trust.</p>

<p>We explained bayesian weights pretty fully in our previous article. Here's what we said then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site, and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings. The basic formula looks like this:<p><code>
b(r) = [ W(a) * a + W(r) * r ] / (W(a) + W(r)]</code><p>r = average rating for an item<p>W(r) = weight of that rating, which is the number of ratings<p>a = average rating for your collection<p>W(a) = weight of that average, which is an arbitrary number, but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items; 100 is used here, for a database which expects many ratings per item<p>b(r) = new bayesian rating <p>Say three "shill" users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a "10" because the producer asked them to. However, you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100, and thus 3 ratings won't move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50:<p><code>
b(r) = [100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10] / (100 + 3)</code><code><br>b(r) = 680 / 103</code><code><br>b(r) = 6.60
</code>
<table border=1 width=90% cellpading=3><tr>















</table>
</blockquote>

<p>We implemented bayesian weights exactly as we'd detailed, but with a lower weight of 25. Since then we've accrued over 10,000 ratings in the database, and we can probably start thinking about cranking that weight up, another topic we'll return to.</p>

<p>Our trust-based algorithms suggest that some ratings are better than others, and should thus be more trusted (and thus more weighted when we calculate the average rating of an item). Though bayesian weights have been used before, we're not aware of other systems that weight ratings based on trust. </p>

<p>The calculation of trust is very simple:</p>

<p><code>
Weight = 0 if #ratings(user) &lt;= 2</code><code><br>Otherwise Weight = #ratings(user) / 50 to a maximum of 2</code><code><br>Weight *= 2, to a maximum of 4, if the user included a comment
</code>

</p>

<p>This was based on the idea that the average good rater would rate 25 different items and the average great rater would rate at least 50. Additionally, we believed that ratings with comments were more likely to be thoughtful than those without.</p>

<p>That, overall, is a quick picture of what we've done with the RPGnet Gaming Index. Some of these ideas were laid out from the start, and others have been tuned as we progressed. </p>

<p>So how did we do, particularly in comparison to our existing RPGnet Reviews System?</p>



<h3>The Comparison</h3>

<p>One of our goals in improving rating systems has been to widen the range of possible input. As we noted earlier we discovered that 90% of our RPGnet Reviews Ratings were in the 3-5 range, and only 10% in the 1-2 range.</p>

<p>Generally, we can measure the success of widening a range by seeing whether the average rating of a database moves toward the <em>true</em> average. For the purposes of a 10-point scale from 1-10, that's a desired value of 5.5. That generally means we're looking for our average rating to <em>decrease</em> because people tend to rate high.</p>

<p>The following table compares the average results of Reviews ratings and Index ratings.</p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=3><tr><td><strong>Database</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average</strong></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Converted Reviews</strong></td>

<td>7.25</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Massaged Reviews</strong></td>

<td>7.29</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Unweighted Index</strong></td>

<td>7.10</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Weighted Index</strong></td>

<td>6.78</tr>
</table></center>

<p>Here's what the categories in the above chart represent:</p>

<p><strong>Converted Reviews:</strong> The Style + Substance of the Reviews, converted from its 2-10 scale to a 1-10 scale: </p>

<p><code>
$rating = avg($style) + avg($substance);</code><br><code>$rating = ($rating * 1.125) - 1.25;
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Massaged Reviews:</strong> The Style + Substance of the Reviews, with Substance given double weight over Style because we think that more closely reflects the intentions of the reviewer, converted from its 2-10 scale to a 1-10 scale:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = (average($style) + 2*average($substance))/1.5;</code><br><code>$rating = ($rating * 1.125) - 1.25;
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Unweighted Index:</strong> Index ratings exactly as users have entered into our Gaming Index:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = average($index-rating);
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Weighted Index:</strong> Index ratings adjusted by the weight of each individual rating, which is based on user trust and inclusion of comments:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = average($index-rating*$index-weight)/average($index-weight);
</code>

</p>

<p>Our average rating—which is our criteria for success—decreased somewhat from the Reviews System to the Gaming Index and it decreased much more dramatically when we introduced our trust systems.</p>

<p>The following chart shows the a typical example of how review and index ratings differ, using the venerable <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook</em> as an example:</p>

<center><a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry-ratings.phtml?mainid=72"><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only.jpg alt=Dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only title=Dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only.jpg alt=Dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only title=Dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only></a></center><p>For this book the median ratings from reviews-only is 8, and the median from index-only is 7. A one-to-two point drop in median rating from reviews to index was consistent in all of our most-rated games other than those which were a rated a "10" in both places.</p>

<p>We believe that this initial success of our unweighted Gaming Index can be attributed to the slightly better <em>granularity</em>—a 10-point scale versus two 5-point scales—and our improved <em>distinctiviness</em>—based on better naming of the rating levels. The veracity of this will ultimately be played out as the Index grows.</p>

<p>However we have no doubt that our <em>statistical</em> approach to the index data, when we moved from our unweighted Index to our weighted Index, is providing even better results. We had theorized that users who input more and who include comments would provide "better" data, and by our criteria of the average of the ratings moving toward 5.5 that seems to be borne out. The following table looks at the information a bit more precisely, by comparing average ratings as total number of ratings increases over several ranges:</p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=3><tr><td><strong># of Ratings</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average w/Comment</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average w/o Comment</strong></tr>
<tr><td><strong>1-2</strong></td>

<td>8.55</td>

<td>8.88</tr>
<tr><td><strong>3-24</strong></td>

<td>8.08</td>

<td>8.16</tr>
<tr><td><strong>25-49</strong></td>

<td>7.32</td>

<td>7.11</tr>
<tr><td><strong>50-99</strong></td>

<td>7.14</td>

<td>7.03</tr>
<tr><td><strong>100+</strong></td>

<td>6.17</td>

<td>6.99</table></center>

<p>This table fairly definitively shows that base maxim: that the breadth of the ratings, and thus their quality, increases the more ratings a user makes. The improved quality of ratings with comments is less definitive. Among the vast mass of users the two values are pretty close, and sometimes the reverse of what we expect, but for the best and the worst users, ratings with comments seem to be better than those without. This latter point is another one that we'll have to continue to monitor as the Index grows beyond its current total of 10,000 ratings.</p>

<p>The other major element of our <em>statistical</em> approach to the Index is our bayesian weight. The following chart shows a top-ten chart for roleplaying games calculated via four different methodologies: our Reviews; our Index with no weighting; our Index with a 25 bayesian weighting (as it currently stands); and our Index with a 50 bayesian weighting:</p>

<p>We actually <em>did</em> do a little bit of statistical analysis on the Reviews because on our first try to produce this chart we got a random clump of reviews that were 5/5 from a much larger pool, so we further ordered them by descending total count of reviews, and as a result you're seeing a better selection of ranked reviews than a truly unstatistical sampling would allow. We did the same for the unweighted Index (which clumped a number of results at "10"), except we further ordered items at the same weight by decreasing number of views (another statistical decision).</p>

<p>Clearly, deciding which of these lists is "right" is a much more subjective measure than the mathematical analysis we were able to apply to earlier problems. However, most roleplayers would tell you that the unweighted Reviews and Index lists are terrible. The top 5 items in the Reviews list actually aren't bad for a starting list of good games—but only because we did the aforementioned statistical ordering. Before that we just had a random listing of gaming items. Even with our attempts at quickie statistical analysis the unweighted Index is still quite bad, with only <em>Talislanta</em> regularly showing up on other "best" lists.</p>

<p>The problem is the ability of one person to come in and rate an item a "10" (or a "5"/"5"), thereby making that item more highly rated than <em>any</em> item which has an actual consensus of ratings. Of our unweighted top Reviews only the top three had more than 2 reviews and the rest had 2. Not surprisingly those top three were the best fits to a typical top-ten list. Of the unweighted Index only the top three had more than 1 rating, and the rest had 1. Our single good pick was in those top three.</p>

<p>Our 25-weight Index, which is what we currently use, has been generally accepted by the RPGnet community as a good marker of what's good and what's not. However there have been two items on it which some percentage of people disagree with: <em>Spirit of the Century</em> and <em>Pulp Hero</em>. It's instructive to see that when we increase to a 50-weight Index <em>Spirit of the Century</em> drops (even more notably than depicted here, because its actual rating changes from .01 from first place to .16 from first place) and <em>Pulp Hero</em> disappears entirely.</p>

<p>The questions of <em>what</em> to set your bayesian weight to, when to increase it, and what maximum value to set it to are all relatively unstudied and thus we don't have good answers to them. As we pass 10,000 ratings we're considering upping the bayesian value to 50. We expect that 100 will be our ultimate value when the Index is fully mature, however if we increase the weight too far an older, less rated game will never be able to get enough weight to get out of the doldrums.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We're by no means done with this ratings experiment. Though we've pleased and impressed with the growth of the RPGnet Index thus far, by next year we hope that the Index will include the vast majority of all games in print (as opposed to somewhat less than half now) and that our 10,000 ratings will grow to 50,000 or more. This will allow us to offer even more definitive answers to our questions.</p>

<p>In the meantime we're still mucking with our statistics and facing new problems.  Some of the newest:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What to do about drive-by ratings:</strong> Our trust algorithm does a good job of making drive-by ratings, where a publisher points his audience to an item in our site, mostly irrelevant, but there's some concern that they could have more effect in the long run.</li>

<li><strong>How to incorporate our review ratings in our index ratings:</strong> It seems a shame to waste the thousands of reviews that have been written—and indeed currently they're calculated into a composite rating we use in the Index—but we're realizing that people have very different purposes for writing reviews and inputing ratings, which may result in some of the upward skew we see on the review side of things. Ultimately we need to decide whether they're just too different or whether our statistical massaging is enough to incorporate those reviews into a composite Index rating.</li>

<li><strong>How to pick some of our numbers:</strong> As we already noted we don't have good formulas for when to choose which bayesian weights. Likewise we've been guessing at which values to use for the trust-based weighting of our raters. Originally we set our desired rating count to 100 for good rater and 200 for great raters, but we've since dropped those to 50 for good and 100 for great based upon the real numbers of ratings that users were making. Again, we'd prefer to derive an actual formula for this type of calculation</ul>

<p>Shannon has discussed some of these issues more in his recent article <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_198.phtml>More Thoughts Abour Ratings</a>.</p>

<p>Despite unanswered questions, we still feel good about the basic ideas we laid out in our article last year. We have no doubt that giving our ratings a <em>statistical</em> basis has dramatically improved them and evidence thus far suggests that both <em>granularity</em> and <em>distinctiveness</em> have been helpful as well.<br>

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>My colleague, <a href=http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline.php>Shannon Appelcline</a>, has been working on a game rating system for <a href=http://www.rpg.net>RPGnet</a>. This has resulted in real-world application of the principles for designing rating systems which we've previously discussed in our <a href=../2005/12/collective_choi.html>Collective Choice</a> articles. Shannon's newest article, <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_196.phtml>Ratings,
Who Do You Trust?</a> offers a look at weighting ratings based on reliability.</p>

<p><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/shannon_appelcline.jpg alt=Shannon_appelcline title=Shannon_appelcline style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"><blockquote><p><em>On the <a href=http://index.rpg.net/>RPGnet Gaming Index</a> we've put this all together to form a tree of weighted ratings that answer the question, <em>who do you trust</em>?</em></p>

<p><em>Here's how we measured each type of trust, and what we did about it:</em></p>

<ul><li><p><em><strong>Volume of Ratings for an Item.</strong> Introduce a bayesian weight to offset the variability of items with low-volume ratings.</em></li>

<li><p><em><strong>Volume of Ratings by a User.</strong> Give each user a weight based on his volume of contribution which is applied to his ratings.</em></p>
</li>

<li><p><em><strong>Depth of Content by a User.</strong> Give each rating a weight based on the depth of thought implicit in the rating which is applied to that rating.</em></p>
</ul>

<p><em>These all get put together to create our final ratings for
the Gaming Index, with each user's individual rating for an item
getting multiplied by its user weight and its content weight, and then
all of that averaged with the other user ratings and the bayesian
weight too. The result is in no way intuitive, but users don't really
need to understand the back end of a rating system. Conversely we hope
it's accurate, or at least more accurate than would otherwise be true
given the relatively low volume of ratings we've collected thus far.</em></p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>In <a href=../2005/12/collective_choi.html>Collective Choice: Rating Systems</a> I discuss ratings scales of various sorts, from eBay's 3-point scale to RPGnet's double 5-point scale, and BoardGame Geek's 10-point scale.</p>

<p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/stars_1.gif alt=Stars_1 height=128 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Stars_1></a></p>

<p>Of the various ratings scales, 5-point scales are probably the most common on the Internet. You can find them not just in my own RPGnet, but also on Amazon, Netflix, and iTunes, as well as many other sites and services. Unfortunately 5-point rating scales also face many challenges in their use, and different studies suggest different flaws with this particular methodology.</p>

<p>First, <a href=http://sloan.ucr.edu/category/working-papers/product-reviews/>one study</a> using Amazon data has shown that many <em>undetailed</em> ratings (where the rater isn't required to add any additional information other than the rating they select) show a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution>bimodal distribution</a>.  In other words the distribution of ratings tends to cluster around two different numbers (e.g., 1 and 5) rather than offering a normal distribution where the ratings cluster around a single height (e.g., 3). Thus the median of these ratings is not an accurate reflection of product quality, but instead is a statement of conflicting opinions.</p>

<p>Second, <a href=../2005/12/collective_choi.html>our own study</a> using RPGnet data has shown that many <em>detailed</em> ratings (where the rater does add additional information, in this case a full review) offer normal distributions, however it is biased toward the high end of the scale. On RPGnet, for example, we discovered that 90% of this 5-point rating system was 3 or higher with an average around 4.</p>

<p><a href=http://360.yahoo.com/profile-9lciejI3aafX1stHPoIRNmkmv4EowQ-->Randy Farmer</a> of Yahoo suggests that this scale limitation is particularly troublesome for fan-based ratings, such as those found on episodic TV sites:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Only the fans of a show evaluate the episodes, and being fans, will never rate an episode one or two stars, ever. I've seen this attempted over and over on the net with the same results every time: Each episode of a show is 4-stars +/- .5 stars. This goes all the way back to the Babylon-5 website, probably the first source for this kind of data.</em></blockquote>

<p>(And indeed, the TV episode <a href="http://www.tv.com/babylon-5/tko/episode/25148/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;14">TKO</a>, from <em>Babylon 5</em>'s first season, is considered an entirely atrocious episode by even the fans. Yet it has a 6.1 of 10 "Fair" rating on <a href=http://www.tv.com>tv.com</a>.)</p>

<p>Thus even when a bimodal distribution is not a problem, on a 5-point scale the upward bias often results in only 2 or 3 meaningful data points. This is problematic because it minimizes differentiation. In many cases, a 5-star rating system where most of the ratings are either 3 or 4 is actually no better then just a thumbs-up/thumbs-down rating system. </p>

<p>However, given that 5-point scales are probably here to stay, we are forced to make the best use of them we can.</p>

<p>First, we need to provide raters with <em>incentives</em>, so that they provide meaningful ratings. We've already seen that this can be done by requesting detailed ratings: when a person takes the time to write text, and knows that his name will be attached to it, he generally does a better job in his rating. There are other possible incentives techniques as well, such as RPGnet's new <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_191.phtml>XP System</a>.</p>

<p>Second, we need to provide means for a 5-point scale to become more meaningful by encouraging raters to use not just the top half of the scale, but the bottom half as well. One method to accomplish this is to make ratings <em>distinct</em> -- as I briefly mentioned in my previous article on this topic -- and encourage standards so that an "average" rating is 2 or 3, not 4.</p>

<p>As an example of how to accomplish both of these goals with already existing 5-point rating scales, I've detailed my own experiences with using ratings on two popular services -- iTunes and Amazon. By providing myself with incentives and making my use of ratings very distinctive, I have created more meaningful and useful output for myself.</p>

<h3>Music Ratings - iTunes</h3>

<p>Apple's iTunes software offers you the ability to rate individual songs with a 0-5 Star rating. If you use iTunes with an iPod, you can change the rating of a song on your iPod and the change will be reflected in your iTunes database the next time you sync your iPod. The "Shuffle Songs" feature available on more modern iPods has an option to have songs with higher ratings be played more often. A very powerful feature, Smart Playlists, can dynamically create sophisticated playlists based on ratings. All of this makes rating music on iTunes very useful.</p>

<p>After Shannon and I wrote our Rating Systems article, I examined the ratings in my iTunes catalog. Using the <a href=http://girtby.net/archives/2005/11/03/itunes-library-preening/>Alastair's</a> fabulous XLST <a href=http://girtby.net/offerings/itunes-ratings-stats/>iTunes rating statistics tool</a>, I discovered that the ratings I created in iTunes clearly were biased overly high, matching the pattern we'd described. I had far too many songs rated with 4 Stars, and almost nothing rated 1 or 2. This made my ratings less useful.</p>

<p>So over the last few months I've completely revamped my iTunes ratings. Since I can't change the user interface, I've changed my behavior. I'm also taking advantage of two other fields: "checked" which I use to give more distinctiveness to my ratings, and "play count" which shows whether or not I've listened to something through to the end.</p>

<p>Here are the criteria I used:</p>

<p><strong>Rated 5 - Exemplars <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_5_checked.png alt=Myrating_5_checked title=Myrating_5_checked>:</strong> Only my most favorite songs are rated 5. They have to meet the following criteria: they make me feel good or excite me no matter how often I listen to them, I can typically listen to them often without getting tired of them, and they are the best of their particular genre.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 4 - Great <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_4_checked.png alt=Myrating_4_checked title=Myrating_4_checked>:</strong> There is only a small difference between a song that is rated 4 and 5 in my ratings -- typically it doesn't excite me or make me smile quite as much, or it isn't necessarily an exemplar of its genre. However, I still can typically listen to them often without getting tired of them. Items that are rated 4 and 5 are ones that I carry on my iPod Shuffle.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 4 - Great (Unchecked) <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_4_unchecked.png alt=Myrating_4_unchecked title=Myrating_4_unchecked>:</strong> There are a few songs that I do consider to be great, but that I only want to play when I'm in the mood for them, or I want to only play in a specific order, or they "don't play well" with other music. For instance I love the song "The Highwayman" by Loreena McKennitt, however, it is over 10 minutes long and I just don't want to hear that type of song unless I'm in the mood for it. Other examples are the 12 songs that make up Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition"  -- I want them played in order when I do play them, and I really don't want them played in the middle of my other songs. Unfortunately, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items, so I don't have a Smart Playlist for these; instead I keep them in a regular playlist.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 3 - Good <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_3_checked.png alt=Myrating_3_checked title=Myrating_3_checked>:</strong> These are songs I like. Typically I can play them regularly but not too often. Songs rated 3-5 go on my iPod Nano.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 3 - Good (Unchecked) <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_3_unchecked.png alt=Myrating_3_unchecked title=Myrating_3_unchecked>:</strong> There is a lot of music that I think is Good, but I don't want to play all the time. I have a large catalog of sound tracks from movies. All but a few of those tracks are in this category. Again, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items in a Smart Playlist, so I have several regular playlists for these items.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 2 - Ok <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_2_checked.png alt=Myrating_2_checked title=Myrating_2_checked>:</strong> I have very diverse musical tastes, starting with jazz, various ethnic and world music, and also including quite a bit of pop, rap, R&amp;B, punk, and metal that I enjoy. I don't enjoy them all the time -- but I do like them to pop up every once in a while for variety. So I rate these 2 and leave them checked. I have an old 40GB iPod that I take on long trips, and it stores everything I have that is checked and rated 2-5.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 2 - Ok (Unchecked) <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_2_unchecked.png alt=Myrating_2_unchecked title=Myrating_2_unchecked>:</strong> Some songs are OK, but I really have to be in the mood specifically for that song. Listening to Jimmy Buffet's "Margaritaville" can be a guilty pleasure on a lazy summer day at the beach, but it isn't something I want to regularly listen to. I have a number of special playlists for songs rated like this.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 1 - Don't Like <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_1_checked.png alt=Myrating_1_checked title=Myrating_1_checked>:</strong> These are the songs that I don't like. They're just not my style. Many are still quality music, they just doesn't work for me. I do keep most of these for completeness -- it might just be one or two songs on the album, and I want to keep the album complete. Or I keep it in case my tastes change. But in general, once something is rate 1 Star, I'll probably never listen to it again.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 1 - Trash (Unchecked) <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_1_unchecked.png alt=Myrating_1_unchecked title=Myrating_1_unchecked>:</strong> These are songs that not only do I not like, they just are not good music. I don't like most rap music, but I can tell that most are still quality. Some are junk -- these I rate 1 and uncheck, and are candidates for deletion the next time I purge my collection.</p>

<p><strong>Unrated &amp; Listened <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_0_checked.png alt=Myrating_0_checked title=Myrating_0_checked>, playcount &gt; 0:</strong> If I've listened to something through to the end, but haven't rated it yet, it shows up in this Smart Playlist. Periodically I check this Smart Playlist, sort by playcount, and try to rate everything that I've listened to more then once.</p>

<p><strong>Unrated &amp; Unlistened <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/myrating_0_checked.png alt=Myrating_0_checked title=Myrating_0_checked>, play count=0:</strong> This is the default when a new song is added to my library. So any song that is unrated, checked, and has a play count of 0 shows up in my "Unrated &amp; Unlistened" Smart Playlist. When I'm in the mood for variety, I go through this playlist and rate songs.</p>

<p>Modifying my rating system in this way has caused my average rating for music to change from around 4 to somewhere between 2 and 3. It will probably, over time, become closer to 2 as I rate more of my collection. This gives me a lot of distinctiveness so that I can create Smart Playlists that work well for me.</p>

<p>Obviously rating a large music collection can become a chore -- you don't want to spend your limited music listening time always fine tuning your ratings. So I have some approaches that make it easier for me to rate my music with less effort:</p>

<ul><li><p>First, I sorted my catalog by my old ratings, and modified everything down by 1, Starting with everything rated 2 becoming 1, 3 becoming 2, etc. This gave me a good base to start with</li>

<li><p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/exemplar_smart_playlist.png onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=512,height=216,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/exemplar_smart_playlist.png alt=Exemplar_smart_playlist height=84 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Exemplar_smart_playlist></a>
Next I created Smart Playlists for each rating, i.e. "Rating 5 - Exemplar" with "Match only checked songs" and "Live updating" checked. I then added "Play Count" as a column to my view, and sorted by it. This gave me the songs that I played the most and least, and I adjusted some songs up and down accordingly.</li>

<li><p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist.png onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=512,height=241,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist.png alt=Plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist height=94 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist></a>
Then I created a new Smart Playlist that simply plays songs rated 3 to 5, limiting the list to the first 100 GB selected by random (i.e. everything random), and saved this Smart Playlist as "Plays Well With Others". I play this on occasion in the background, and when I hear something that jars me I know something isn't rated right. Thus without a lot of effort I can change ratings for songs that no longer fit their rating, or uncheck items where the rating was appropriate but it "didn't play well with others".</li>

<li><p>I try to be aware when I'm using my iPod of what a songs rating is, and change it if it seems wrong. The next time I sync the iPod my ratings will be adjusted in my iTunes catalog.</li>

<li><p><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/play_count.png alt=Play_count title=Play_count style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;">I also try to be aware of Play Count -- this number only goes up if you play a song to the end. So even if I'm not able to take a look at the rating (for instance when I'm in a car), I can at least forward to the next song. Periodically I review the play counts for songs that I've rated and consider moving them up and down accordingly. Of course, this means that I have to be careful and not let the iPod keep running when I'm not listening.</ul>

<p>A tip for those of you that do put a lot of effort into your iTunes ratings: I've learned the hard way that unlike most song information, the rating is <strong>NOT</strong> stored in the song itself, so if your iTunes database gets corrupted, or you move your music to another server, you'll lose all your ratings. One way to avoid this is to periodically backup your ratings into a field that is stored in the song itself. I personally use the "Grouping" field as it is rarely used, select all songs with the same rating and click on "Get Info", and change the Grouping field to "My Rating: 5 Stars".</p>

<p>I only have 11% of my collection rated so far, but using this system I'm finding it a lot easier to manage my ratings. I'm already getting many benefits from it -- I'm playing my music more often, my iPods typically have the music I want on them, and various music discovery services can use my ratings to help me identify new music I might enjoy. This provides the <em>incentive</em> to keep me entering meaningful ratings.</p>

<h3>Book Ratings - Amazon</h3>

<p>Amazon also uses a 5-Star rating system, and your ratings can be used by Amazon to help you find books that you might like. Though I like to support my local bookstores, it is this feature that brings me back to Amazon time and again. Whenever I browse through Amazon and see a book I've already read I try to take the time to update my rating.</p>

<p>Amazon has a number of different tools to assist you in your ratings. If you are an Amazon customer, you can go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/iyr/?ie=UTF8&amp;collection=owned">Improve Your Recommendations: Edit Items You Own</a> and see all the books that you've purchased and quickly rate them with a nice AJAX interface. You can also review items that you've already rated, whether or not you own them, at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/iyr/?ie=UTF8&amp;collection=rated">Improve Your Recommendations: Edit Items You've Rated</a>.</p>

<p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/amazon_your_media_library.png onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=509,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/amazon_your_media_library.png alt=Amazon_your_media_library height=159 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Amazon_your_media_library></a>
Amazon has also recently added a very nice web service called <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/library/>Your Media Library</a> that can be used to help manage your media library of books, music, and dvds. I personally only have used it to manage my books and dvds, as I find rating albums useless -- it is songs that I prefer to rate.</p>

<p>After browsing through my ratings to date, I discovered the same flaws I found iTunes -- my ratings typically were too high; most were a 4. This is particularly encouraged by the popup when your cursor is over the Stars "1 - I hate it, 2 - I don't like it, 3 - It's Ok, 4 - I like it, and 5 - I love it". I suspect if I use the same trick that I use for iTunes of making a rating of 2 Stars mean "Ok" I could potentially cause the recommendation engine to be less effective (though it could possibly make it better, I don't know). So I am being much more brutal with my ratings and pushing many more down to 3, so that my ratings of 4 and 5 have more meaning.</p>

<p><strong>5 Stars <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/amazon_5_star.png alt=Amazon_5_star title=Amazon_5_star>:</strong> These have to be the exemplars -- the best books I've ever read, would be glad to read again, would be proud to show off on my best bookshelf, and will buy extra copies to give to friends.</p>

<p><strong>4 Stars <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/amazon_4_star.png alt=Amazon_4_star title=Amazon_4_star>:</strong> These have to be really good books -- most of them I'm willing to read again and I promote them by offering to loan them to my more discriminating friends. Although I may keep them on my bookshelf I'd rather give them to a friend then sell them at a used book store.</p>

<p><strong>3 Stars <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/amazon_3_star.png alt=Amazon_3_star title=Amazon_3_star>:</strong> These are books are decent books, and I do share them with my voracious reader friends. But I don't push them and I'm much more likely to sell them at a used bookstore then keep them on my shelf. This is the rating that I significantly underused previously, and I'm finding that the key discriminator for me so far is how much I feel like recommending this to friends who are more discriminating readers.</p>

<p><strong>2 Stars <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/amazon_2_star.png alt=Amazon_2_star title=Amazon_2_star>:</strong> This rating is where the Amazon rating system fails the most -- these are suppost to be books that "I don't like", however, most of the time I don't buy books that I probably wouldn't like, much less read them, so I have very few in this category. However, I've decided this category is for books that are just not quite good enough, or are slightly disappointing. Not bad, or disliked, but just somewhat disappointing.</p>

<p><strong>1 Stars <img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/amazon_1_star.png alt=Amazon_1_star title=Amazon_1_star>:</strong> This is where I put the books that I don't like, or worse, I hate. Not many here, but I'm willing to risk more then many people are so I have some. Also books go here that just don't fit my interest, like romance novels that get recommended to me because I like some crossover fantasy-romance authors.</p>

<p>Since I started more accurately rating my books at Amazon, I've found that their suggestions for other books to read to be more accurate. Thus I am getting value from rating these books, and I have <em>incentive</em> to continue to make the effort.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Offering an incentive for people to rate is important for ratings of all sorts, with both individual gain and status recognition being powerful motivators.</p>

<p>However the easiest technique for making a 5-point rating scale more useful is to make it "distinct". If a user has a more specific meaning for each rating, ratings will slowly settle toward a truer average, and thus more of each rating scale will be used. We've also tried this technique recently on RPGnet, with our new <a href=http://index.rpg.net/>Gaming Index</a>; and thus far our new 10-point scale -- which has distinct meanings for each number -- is averaging <a href="http://index.rpg.net/browse.phtml?count=50&amp;type=Best&amp;productCategory=Entries">7.27</a>. That's still a fair amount above the real average of 5.5, but at least it's below the 8+ rating that our old double 5-point scale resulted in.</p>

<p>Often you, as a consumer of rating systems, will be making use of rating scales designed by others, rather than those you're designing yourself. For those cases it often makes sense to design your own rules for what each number means, and to do so in such a way that your median is the average of the scale, rather than toward one of the extremes. When you do, even if you're using a tight 5-point scale you'll end up with enough differentiation for it to actually be more meaningful than a thumbs up or a thumbs down.</p>

<p><em>[This is the third in a series of articles on <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html>collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href=http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline>Shannon Appelcline</a>.

<p>In our first article on <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html>collective choice</a> we outlined a number of different types of choice systems, among them voting, polling, rating, and ranking. Since then we've been spending some time expanding upon the systems, with the goal being to create both a lexicon of and a dialogue about systems for collective choice.</p>

<p>This time we're going to dig more into <em>comparison ranking systems</em>, by focusing on <em>competitive</em> rankings and looking more in depth at ELO Chess Ranking System and the other systems that we briefly mentioned previously. Our goal is to explicate these systems, to better address their flaws, to begin detailing the purposes of ranking systems, and to show how those purposes are critical in the design of ranking systems.</p>

<h3><a name=subjective_vs_objective></a>Subjective vs. Objective Rankings</h3>

<p>In our original article we discussed <a href=../2005/12/collective_choi.html>rating systems</a> as being largely subjective and ranking systems as being objective, but the situation isn't nearly as simple as that. In truth, there's a clear spectrum of ratings and rankings with varying amounts of subjectivity and objectivity in each collective choice system. </p>

<p><a href=http://www.bcsfootball.org/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/bcs_1.png alt=Bcs_1 title=Bcs_1 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"></a>
<a href=http://www.officialworldgolfranking.com/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/golfrankings_1.png alt=Golfrankings_1 title=Golfrankings_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>

The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series>Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) for college football is a good example of a ranking system that explicitly allows a subjective component. It involves a complex mathematical formula that includes things like win/loss ratios, but also sportswriters' and coaches' ratings. </p>

<p>However, public opinion continues to show that people don't necessarily like seeing true ranking systems having subjective components, because they expect them to be "fair". The BCS formula has come under attack several times in the last few years precisely due to its subjective basis. Cal Berkeley was one of several teams denied a bowl position in 2004 when many felt that they were worthy.</p>

<p>The <a href=http://www.atptennis.com/en/players/raceleaderboard/rank_definitions.asp>APL tennis rankings</a> and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_rankings>official world golf rankings</a> also have a subjective component, but it is much more subtle. Each tournament is worth a certain number of points, and the allocation of those points is relatively arbitrary, based upon the "prestige" of each tournament and the quality of players who have traditionally played in it. The subjectivism isn't quite as near to the surface as that of the college bowls, but it's still something that can have a notable, and perhaps unwarranted, effect upon the final results.<br> </p>

<h3><a name=algorithmic_rankings></a>Algorithmic Rankings</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.kosteniuk.com/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/wcsrating_2.jpg alt=Wcsrating_2 title=Wcsrating_2 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
This brings us back to the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system>ELO system</a>, a ranking system originally designed for chess which is fairly well-known and well-understood. As we said in our overview article, "[ELO] builds a simple distribution of player ratings around a norm (typically 1500 points), then awards or deducts points based upon wins and losses, with the total sum of all points in the system staying constant. Players are then ranked according to their comparative scores."</p>

<p>The big difference between this and the previously discussed systems is that it's almost entirely objective; in fact it uses a statistical basis to create an underlying mathematical model for rankings, rather than allowing human subjectivity to get in the way.<br>

</p>

<p>The simplest formulation for an ELO rating looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span size=+2><code>R' = R + K * (S - E)</code></span></p>

<p><code>R'</code> is the new rating<br>
<code>R</code> is the old rating<br>
<code>K</code> is a maximum value for increase or decrease of rating (16 or 32 for ELO)<br>
<code>S</code> is the score for a game<br>
<code>E</code> is the expected score for a game</blockquote>

<p>Much of the trick is in figuring out what the (<code>E</code>)xpected score of a game is. ELO uses the following formulas for players A and B:</p>

<blockquote><pre>E(A) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [R(B) - R(A)] / 400 ) ]<br>E(B) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [R(A) - R(B)] / 400 ) ]</pre></blockquote>

<p>It's a good model because, using the two formulas, it means that a great player gains little from beating an average player, but an average player gains a lot from beating a great player. Take the following example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>R(A) = 1900<br>R(B) = 1500<br>
E(A) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [1500 - 1900] / 400 ) ]<br>     = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( -400 / 400) ]<br>     = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ -4 / 4 ]<br>     = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ -1 ]<br>     = 1 / 1 + .1<br>     = .91<br>     = 91%<br><p>E(B) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [1900 - 1500] / 400) ]<br>     = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( 400 / 400 ) ]<br>     = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ 1 ]<br>     = 1 / 11<br>     = .09<br>     = 9%</pre></blockquote>

<p>Player A is expected to score .91 in an average game, which is to say he should win 91% of the time, and will be punished accordingly if he loses to player B:</p>

<blockquote><pre>R' = 1900 + 32 * (0 - .91)<br>R' = 1900 - 29.12<br>R' = 1871</pre></blockquote>

<p>Conversely a win nets him very little:</p>

<blockquote><p>
R' = 1900 + 32 * (1 - .91)<br>R' = 1900 + 32 * .09<br>R' = 1900 + 2.88<br>R' = 1903</blockquote>

<p>ELO is almost entirely mathematical. Players can gain or lose different amounts of points based upon playing different players, but this is all part of the formula. The only slightly subjective element is the definition of <code>K</code> -- how much a player can win or lose from a particular game. The most widely used ELO systems for Chess break <code>K</code> down into two values: 16 for masters and 32 for everyone else. So there is a subjective decision that masters should vary their score less frequently than other players. </p>

<p>That's a very minor element in an otherwise objective system, but as we'll see, more recent systems by Days of Wonder and Microsoft first reduce, then eliminate even this subjectivity.</p>

<h3><a name=days_of_wonder></a>Variations of a Theme: Days of Wonder</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.daysofwonder.com/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/dowlogo_1.gif alt=Dowlogo_1 title=Dowlogo_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
ELO is probably the most used ranking system in the world. You can find it in use for Go, <em>Tantrix</em>, and many other games. Days of Wonder, producers of <em>Gang of Four</em>, <em>Ticket to Ride</em>, and many other games use a variant of the system which they describe on <a href="http://www.gangoffour.com/index.php?t=content&amp;sub=ranking">their website</a>.</p>

<p>They identify three core problems with ELO: </p>

<ol>
<li>New players can take a long time to ascend or descend to their correct levels.</li>
<li>Highly ranked players can be hesitant to play with provisional players whose ranking might be much more uncertain.</li>
<li>There are no allowances for games with more than two players.</li>
</ol>

<p>Days of Wonder resolved the first problem by creating a new formula for provisional players, allowing them to rise and fall in the rankings much more quickly. </p>

<p>Conversely when playing against provisional players, regular players can only lose a maximum of <code>K*n/20</code> points, where n is the number of games that the provisional player has played--rather than the normal maximum loss of <code>K</code>. For example, playing someone who has just played one game, can only result in a loss of 1/20th of the regular <code>K</code> value, and so it really doesn't matter if the provisional player's ranking is wildly out of whack.</p>

<p>Both of these new formulas are set up to converge toward a normal ELO formula as a provisional player's number of games approaches 20 (making them a normal player at Days of Wonder).</p>

<p>(It should be pointed out that using the number "20" to define a provisional player, and making a player less provisional in clean 5% steps, inevitably offers yet another small, subjective element into this mathematical formula; as we'll see momentarily Microsoft has more recently incorporated the idea of provisional uncertainty into their core mathematical model, much as the whole ELO system originally turned subjective win and loss statistics into tighter mathematics.)</p>

<p><a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/wonder/TT/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/ttrskotosrankings.png alt=Ttrskotosrankings title=Ttrskotosrankings style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"></a>
Finally, to resolve the situation of multiple players, Days of Wonder considers each game to be a set of duels, as described here:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
There are 4 players in a </em><em>Gang of Four game. Let's name A the winning player, B the second one, C the third one and D the last one. We consider that there were 6 duels: A won against B, C and D. B won against C and D. C won against D. We compute independently the new scores for each duel, and then we average the values for each player</em>.</blockquote>

<p>It's a fairly elegant answer that not only rewards or penalizes all players separately, but also encourages playing for second place, or even third, if first isn't possible.</p>

<p>There have been continued discussions of the Days of Wonder ELO variant in <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/index.php?t=forums">their forums</a>, and the questions raised there are common to many different ranking systems. Some players wanted unranked games, while others thought that having unranked games would discourage people from playing good competitors <em>except</em> in unranked games.  There has also been a lot of discussion regarding <em>Ticket to Ride</em>, a strategy game that supports 2-5 people, and whether the ELO variant system discourages multiperson play.</p>

<p>The various lessons learned at Days of Wonder underline two basic ideas about rankings. First, even with a well-studied system like ELO, there's still a lot to understand, and, second, any ranking system needs to reflect the specifics of what it's ranking -- and what its purpose is.</p>

<h3><a name=xbox_360_live></a>Variations on a Theme: XBox 360 Live</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/default.aspx><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/trueskillxbox360.jpg alt=Trueskillxbox360 title=Trueskillxbox360 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
An even more recent large-scale ranking system is the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/displayArticle.aspx?id=1361">TrueSkill</a> system developed by Microsoft for use with the XBox 360. It appears to be an expanded variant of the <a href=http://math.bu.edu/people/mg/glicko/glicko.doc/glicko.html>glicko</a> ranking system used by the <a href=http://www.freechess.org/>free internet chess server</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the problems identified by Microsoft were the same as those already noted by Days of Wonder and others, including: the uncertainty of provisional ratings and the need to rank players in multiplayer games. However, the TrueSkill system notably expands both issues. Ranking uncertainty is now defined as a mathematical concept and the rankings now support not just multiple players, but also multiple teams.</p>

<p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/trueskill.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=430,height=324,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/trueskill.gif alt=Trueskill height=150 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border=0 width=200 title=Trueskill></a>TrueSkill explicitly includes two values in any ranking: a skill level and an uncertainty level. The first, like the more common ELO ranking, tells how good a player is. The second states how sure that ranking is. The uncertainty rating is effectively a margin of error, similar to those we saw in <em>polling systems</em>. If a first-time player has a skill rating of 25 with an uncertainty rating of 8.3 that means that his skill is probably somewhere in the range of 16.7 to 33.3, a pretty wide range, but then this is a totally untested player. According to benchmarks that Microsoft produced, 99.99% of actual skill levels were within 3x of the uncertainty rating, and 100% were within 4x.</p>

<p>The rest of TrueSkill's innovations are built around this model of uncertainty. All players win or lose skill points, based upon how many players they beat or lose to, and they also decrease their uncertainty rating as they play more games. However, uncertainty is decreased more for players toward the middle of a pack within a game than those around the edges (because on the edges the players could actually be much better or much worse than it is possible to see from a specific game). In addition, TrueSkill is only a zero-sum ranking system for players at the exact same level of uncertainty. The more uncertainty that an opponent possesses, the smaller the weighting of any gain or loss (much like the simpler system that Days of Wonder uses, which bases weightings of games against provisional players as <code>n/20</code>).</p>

<p>Overall TrueSkill is a somewhat complex system that is described more fully at Microsoft's <a href=http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/Details.aspx#How_to_Update_Skills>web site</a>. Some of their expansions had already been considered by others, but still their system is notably innovative in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expanding a competitive ranking system to include concepts of teams.</li>
<li><p>Incorporating the uncertainty of ratings further into the core mathematical model, rather than using a somewhat more subjective model such as that described by Days of Wonder for provisional players.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/RankCalculator.aspx><img src=../photos/uncategorized/trueskillcalculator_1.png alt=Trueskillcalculator_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" class=image-full border=0 title=Trueskillcalculator_1></a>
The TrueSkill calculations are a bit complex. In general, that's not a problem for a computer-based ranking model because you can have a computer doing all the computations, and players only need to understand the results. However the two-part ranking system used by TrueSkill, which notes both skill level and uncertainty, does offer a potential problem on this latter point. <em>Can players understand it?</em> In general, the concept of uncertainty will not be understood by people other that statisticians, thus raising a real user-interface question with the TrueSkill system -- and the exact sort of thing that designers of new ranking systems will need to consider.</p>

<h3><a name=a_tale_in_the_desert></a>Variations on a Theme: A Tale in the Desert</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.atid.com><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/a_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1.jpg alt=A_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1 title=A_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
 The online game, <a href=http://www.atitd.com>A Tale in the Desert</a>, identified a different problem with the ELO system: <em>cheating</em>. This is a uniquely Internet-based problem, because there users can create fake accounts, then defeat those accounts to win points. This can also be done more subtly, by having multiple additional accounts build up the rating of that fake account before the fake account is defeated. So a totally new ranking system, called the <a href=http://wiki.atitd.net/tale1/EGenesis_Ranking_System>eGenesis Ranking System</a>, was created.</p>

<p>Each player is ranked through a 256-bit vector, half of which is initially set to 0 and half of which is set to 1 (therefore creating an average ranking of 128). Whenever a match occurs between players a hash function based on the players' names mathematically selects 32 of those bits, 8 of which are then randomly selected. Among those bits, any 1s in the loser's vector which correspond to 0s in the winner's vector are "transferred".</p>

<p>This simple design corresponds in some ways to ELO's more complex formula. A good player will have more 1s and thus more to lose, and he will lose correspondingly more to a poor player who has more 0s in his vector. </p>

<p>However, the system also prevents the collusion earlier noted. Statistically, a single player will only ever gain 8 ranking points from another new player, since out of the 32 bit hash only eight of those will, on average, be in the correct 0-1 configuration. Expanding a group of players expands the number of points that can potentially be gained, but within real limits.</p>

<p><a href=../2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/wowsocialmap_1.png alt=Wowsocialmap_1 title=Wowsocialmap_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
In fact, the eGenesis system prevents cheating by measuring the size of social networks, then limiting the number of ranking points that can be earned within a social network. It's not necessarily the only way to measure social network size, but its methodology points toward social software as an interesting area for additional study of ranking systems.</p>

<p>As with XBox's TrueSkill, the eGenesis algorithms are overall fairly sophisticated and confusing, perhaps more so than TrueSkill itself. However, unlike TrueSkill the output is very simple: a skill number between 0 and 255. The intricacies are hidden by the system.</p>

<h3><a name=goals></a>Competitive Ranking Goals</h3>

<p>Ultimately, as we mentioned when discussing Days of Wonder, any ranking system has to be measured by what it's trying to do and how well it does that. ELO and similar numerical, long-term ranking systems, are most likely trying to achieve one of three goals:</p>

<p><a name=heirarchy></a><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Players are divided into hierarchies of success, giving players goals to constantly strive for and ways to measure their success (or failure).</p>

<p><a name=matching></a><strong>Matching:</strong> Players can play with other players at their same skill level, rather than having to play beginners or experts who are much better than they are. This generally increases everyone's enjoyment. For computer games, the complexity of a matching system can be largely moderated by the computer, thus ensuring better competition.</p>

<p><a name=handicapping></a><strong>Handicapping:</strong> If players do play against others of different skill levels, the better players can be handicapped in automatic, appropriate ways for the game in question, again increasing the fairness of games and everyone's enjoyment. For instance, someone ranked 3-kyu in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29>Go</a> playing a less experienced 7-kyu player would give him a starting <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_handicap>4 stone advantage</a> to make for better competition.</p>

<p>The ELO system may be a good matching system, which allows players to easily find other players of their same skill level and play against them. However it doesn't provide any way to handicap players, nor would the ELO method necessarily be a good one to analyze handicaps (and conversely a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_handicap>golf handicap</a> might not do a good job of finding like players nor measuring players' ability in a hierarchy). </p>

<p>More recently the XBox system has stated that it's explicitly for matchmaking, with the goal being to always try and match up players at nearly the same skill level. It's also used for hierarchy (or "leaderboards" as it's described in the TrueSkill docs), but that's clearly a subsidiary purpose.</p>

<p>All of these systems would be ineffective for measuring a winner in a live event, which is a very different goal:</p>

<p><strong>Tourney:</strong> A single player is listed as an absolute winner, the "King of the Hill". Often, second, third, and fourth place winners are measured too.</p>

<p>And, the systems we've discussed thus far may not be useful for measuring privileges, yet another goal:</p>

<p><strong>Threshold:</strong> The best ranks of players can be given special privileges, including the ability to create games and form tournaments. Alternatively, they can be given privileges totally outside the game, again giving them something extra to strive for.</p>

<p>For each of these additional goals we may need to consider very different ranking systems, not just variations of ELO.</p>

<h3><a name=tourneys></a>Different Themes: Tourneys</h3>

<p><a href=http://www2.kumc.edu/itc/staff/rknight/tourneys.htm><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/tournament_1.png alt=Tournament_1 title=Tournament_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
There are a number of well-known tournament types which can be used to create a "King of the Hill" ranking.</p>

<p>The simplest is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament>single-elimination tournament,</a> where the winner of each competition moves on to compete with other winners, until there is only one. However, this style of tournament is quite cut-throat and is not suited very well to events where the competition may result in a draw, or where chance is a notable factor in the competition. It also has a very subjective factor in the initial <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament#Seeding>seeding</a> of the rounds. The single-elimination tournament also does not rank the losers. However, by having the losers compete with each other in a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_system_tournament>Swiss-style tournament</a>, the relative strengths of the players can be ranked.</p>

<p><a href=http://jsoo.home.mindspring.com/articles/formats/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/pseudodoubleelimination_1.png alt=Pseudodoubleelimination_1 title=Pseudodoubleelimination_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
An improvement is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-elimination>double-elimination tournament</a> which is now one of the best known tournament systems in sports. Players compete in series of two-player matches, and a player has to lose twice before he's eliminated. This is done through a system of winner and loser brackets, wherein people drop from the winners' brackets to the losers' brackets when they lose once, and drop out altogether when they lose twice.</p>

<p>One problem with standard double-elimination is that there are unusual situations where a significantly inferior player can still make it to the final round, or the last player to remain undefeated can lose only once and still be eliminated. These can be addressed through variants such as face-off (requiring the last two remaining competitors to compete <em>again</em> if the undefeated team is defeated for the first time in the finals) or by <a href=http://jsoo.home.mindspring.com/articles/formats/>reconfiguring the loser's brackets</a>.</p> 

<p><a href=http://www.wscgames.com/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/wsc_1.png alt=Wsc_1 title=Wsc_1 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"></a>
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament>Round-robin tournaments</a>, such as official <a href=http://www.wscgames.com/2005/build/standing/1/topten.html>Scrabble Tournaments</a> involve every player playing a set number of games (24 in the 2005 World Scrabble Championship), facing opponents with similar win-lose records. They then ultimately rank players by their win-lose ratios.</p>

<p>The advantage of these sorts of tournament over an ELO-style ranking is that they're easily understandable and seem fair. In addition, they measure ranking in a much more topical manner: how well someone is playing during a singular instant, rather than over a longer career. As a result they work much better for a live tournament.</p>

<h3><a name=thresholds></a>Different Themes: Thresholds</h3>

<p>As we discussed in our original article on Collective Choice, thresholds are ranking barriers above which members get a special ability--or alternatively levels below which members lose a special ability. They can also act as another goal for a ranking system.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.usgo.org/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/gosmall.jpg alt=Gosmall title=Gosmall style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
In the game of Go there are both <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings#Pro_and_amateur_ranks>amateur</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings#Professional_strength>professional</a> players. Although they aren't technically in the same <a href=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~mechner/go/kyu.html>hierarchy of rankings</a>, the highest Go amateur ranking  (7 dan) is approximately equal to the lowest Go professional ranking (1 dan), forming a de facto threshold.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.uschess.org/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/uscf_1.png alt=Uscf_1 title=Uscf_1 style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"></a>
 Likewise the United States Chess Federation uses their ELO rankings to denote <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_master>Chess Masters</a>. Anyone who achieves 2200 UCSF is given a National Master threshold ranking and anyone who maintains it for 300 games is given a Life Master threshold ranking.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.acbl.org/><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/acblopt2_1.gif alt=Acblopt2_1 title=Acblopt2_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
 The <a href=http://www.acbl.org/>American Contract Bridge Association</a> uses a threshold system where you have to win a certain number of tournaments and thus earn <a href=http://www.acbl.org/about/honorTitles.html>masterpoints</a> in order achieve official rankings such as "section master". Furthermore, players may earn different "colors" of masterpoints depending the difficulty of the tournament, and some ranks require that you earn at least some specific colored masterpoints in order to meet the requirements for the next threshold.</p>

<p>These thresholds are fairly explicitly based on other hierarchical ranking systems, but this doesn't need to be the case. Since determining the purpose of a ranking system is often the first step in designing it, as we delve further into the area of thresholds we may well find that systems specifically dedicated toward measuring thresholds are more likely to do so well.</p>

<p>In our next article we'll consider among other things the Avogadro reputation system, which manages thresholds in such a way as to prevent cheating.</p>

<h3><a name=conclusion></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There's actually a lot of variety in ranking systems, and even though we'd like them to be totally objective, various subjective elements often creep into these systems. In addition, there's a lot of variety in what ranking systems can do. For competitive systems, hierarchy, privilege, matching, and handicapping are some of the top purposes of ranking. Determining what a ranking system is going to do is a necessary first step in designing the system, as different systems will accomplish various goals to a better or worse degree.</p>

<p>ELO, in several variants, is the best studied and most used competitive ranking system. It works particularly well as a matching system. However, even ELO has flaws in it, among them: issues with new player rankings; its core two-player basis; its lack of provisions for teams; a few minor subjective elements; and problems with cheaters. New systems continue to be rolled out on the Internet to resolve these issues, and overall, it's an area of interesting new study.</p>

<p>Tournament systems and threshold systems offer a few good examples of competitive ranking systems with very different purposes, underlying the need to understand what you're doing before you do it.</p>

<p>Ranking systems also lay very near yet another type of Collective Choice: reputation systems. We briefly addressed reputation systems when talking about threshold systems and will return to this in our next article.</p>

                                <p><span style="font-size: 0.7em;">by Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline</span></p>

<p><em>[This is the second of a series of articles on <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html>collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href=http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline>Shannon Appelcline</a>. It will be <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml>jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href=http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml>Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at <a href=http://www.skotos.net/>Skotos</a>.]</em></p>

<p>In our previous article we talked about the many systems available for <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html>collective choice</a>. There are <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html#selection_systems>selection systems</a>, which are primarily centered on voting and deliberation, <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html#opinion_systems>opinion systems</a>, which represent how voting could occur, and finally <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html#comparison_systems>comparison systems</a>, which rank or rate different people or things in a simple, comparative manner.</p>

<p><a href=../.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src=../images/stars_1.gif alt=Stars_1 height=128 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" border=0 width=200 title=Stars_1></a>One purpose of our previous article was to create a dictionary of terms for talking about these related, but clearly different, systems. Another was to start offering analyses of these systems, many of which had not been well studied before their introduction onto the Internet. </p>

<p>However at best our previous article provided an overview of what should be further investigated in each system. This article provides more in-depth coverage of one of the systems we previously outlined: <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html#rating_systems>rating systems</a>.</p>

<p>As we wrote in our previous article, in comparison rating systems <em>"the value of individual items (most frequently goods) rise or fall based upon the largely subjective judgment of individual users."</em> Ratings systems should be clearly differentiated from the closely related <a href=../2005/12/systems_for_col.html#ranking_systems>ranking systems</a>. Ratings systems have a more subjective component, while ranking systems are largely objective. Amazon, Netflix, BoardGameGeek, and even the Stock Market were offered up as examples of ratings systems. Another example of a comparison rating system, and one of the earliest that appeared on the modern Internet, is eBay. The techniques they use are now beginning to show their age.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>eBay: A Failed Rating Experiment</h3>

<p><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/ebaysales.jpg alt=Ebaysales title=Ebaysales style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;">Most rating systems center around rating content, often user-contributed content, and they frequently help apply community values and acclaim to that content. However, the idea of ratings can go far beyond that narrow niche (though that will doubtless be its greatest use as the Internet continues to expand). Early Internet site, <a href=http://www.ebay.com>eBay</a>, was one of the first to widely use user-submitted ratings, and it used them for a different manner: to determine the good traders on their auction site.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as one of the first in this field, eBay made many mistakes which now leave their ratings system only slightly helpful. However, its failures can also provide us with insights in creating new rating systems on the Internet.</p>

<p>eBay allows you to leave positive, negative, or (more recently) neutral feedback for each transaction you conduct in their society. These are aggregated into two numbers. "Feedback Score" is calculated as unique positive feedback received minus unique negative feedback received, and results in a whole number like "32" or "10,302". "Positive Feedback" is calculated as positive feedback received divided by all feedback received, and results in a percentage like "100%" or "99.8%".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for reasons discussed below, almost all feedback is positive, and thus the Feedback Score acts almost entirely as a track record of how many trades someone has made. The Feedback Score could be largely replaced by that single number. You can look at a score of "27", and say, "That's an amateur trader, or someone just getting started", at a score of "3", and say, "That person may or may not know what they're doing", at a score of "10,302", and say, "That person has done a lot of trades." But you still don't know how good the trader is.</p>

<p><a href=../photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg><img src=../photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg alt=Ebayprofile style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" class=image-full border=0 title=Ebayprofile></a>Theoretically, the Positive Feedback percentage should give a more meaningful number, but people so infrequently give bad ratings that, even when they do appear, they look like noise. Does a percentage of "99.8%" on a user with a score of "1,762" mean that the seller has a genuine problem or not? Do those 3 unhappy customers really represent another 30 who were unwilling to actually click the negative feedback? And, did those people have slightly bad experience or really bad experiences? It's pretty hard to say.</p>

<p>Overall, eBay has a few major problems with their rating system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's <strong>non-granular</strong>, with only two options (positive/negative), or more recently three (positive/negative/neutral).</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>non-distinct</strong>, with no useful guidelines on what behaviors should result in each rating.</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>non-statistical</strong>, and thus ends up showing only a gross number of sales, not a real subjective measure.</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>bilateral</strong>, with buyers and sellers rating each other simultaneously, and thus people are afraid to give bad ratings lest they get them in return.</li>

<li><p>It's <strong>meaningless</strong>, because there are no good tools to control who bids on an auction based on Feedback numbers. (Technically it may be legitimate to ban low feedback bidders from an auction, then cancel their bids if they enter the auction, but this is neither obvious, automatic, nor simple.)
</ul>

<p>We're going to address each of these issues in turn, to offer insight into creating new comparison rating systems. The first three topics--granularity, distinction, and a statistical basis--are the most important elements of a good comparison rating system. Bilateral &amp; meaningfulness issues will only be relevant on certain sites.</p>

<p>(As a final caveat: in some ways eBay falls closer in ultimate result to a <em>reputation system</em>, a topic which we'll be covering more in a few articles down the road, but its lessons learned are still entirely accurate for rating systems of all sorts.)</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Granular Ratings</h3>

<p><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/smiley.png alt=Smiley title=Smiley style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;">
In general, <em>people want to be nice</em>. There are exceptions to that rule, perhaps even great numbers of them, but the average, well-adjusted person would prefer to make other people happy, not sad.</p>

<p>This has a notable effect on any comparison rating system, because it means that people are less likely to use the bottom half of any rating scale. If you did a statistical run on eBay, you'd certainly find that more than 99 out of every 100 ratings are positive. This is largely influenced by concerns of bilateral revenge, as discussed below, and the fact that eBay suggests other means of dispute resolution when you try and leave negative feedback. However, <a href=http://www.rpg.net>RPGnet</a>, a roleplaying site which reviews games, comics, books, movies, and more shows a similar trend despite the lack of bilaterality.</p>

<p>RPGnet uses two 5-points scales for reviews, resulting in a total rating of 2-10. Of all the ratings at RPGnet, 6,983 reviews have a total that's above average, a total rating of 6 or more, and 795 have a total that's below average, a total rating of 5 or less. Perhaps there are more people who sit down to write a review because they really like a game than those who do so because they really hated it, but the result of ~90% of reviews being above average is still stunning.</p>

<p>The following table shows all the ratings for each of the two categories that RPGnet uses, "Style" and "Substance":</p>
<p><a href=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9971.phtml><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/rpgnetsettlersreview.png alt=Rpgnetsettlersreview title=Rpgnetsettlersreview style="margin: 0px 0px 15px 5px; float: right;"></a>

<p>This evidence confirms what we'd already suspected. Only 10% of raters use the bottom two ratings in a 5-point scale, and only 2% use the bottom rating. The median of the 5-point scale is actually the fourth point, with a neat bell curve arranged around it.</p>

<p>Because users are innately unwilling to give bad ratings, as evidenced here, useful comparison ratings truly come about only through fractional differences between good ratings. In this case, the difference between "3", "4", and "5" is meaningful, and becomes more meaningful as more ratings are entered. Eventually you can look at a ranked list of ratings and see that "4.2" is a good rating while "3.5" is not.</p>

<p>In order to do this, however, you need enough levels of good ratings to be able to distinguish between them. eBay, only offering one positive rating, does not provide enough differentiation. RPGnet, with its three positive ratings, might. However, sites that offer a 10-point scale are the ones that really seem to be able to produce meaningful statistics. On those sites we can expect that 90% of users will choose between six different numbers, from "5" to "10", and as the number of ratings builds up, this will produce enough differentiation to be meaningful. If you have already adopted a 5-point scale, consider allowing users to select the half-points, giving users a greater ability to differentiate their ratings.<br> </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Distinct Ratings</h3>

<p>No two users are ever going to rate the same; different rating numbers will mean different things to each person. This can introduce minor discrepencies into ratings, if a single individual rates particularly low or high. However, because most ratings are eventually used for comparisons, if that low- or high-rater rates many different things, the ratings equalize. "Item A" is rated low by this person, but so is "Item B", and so they end up in the correct positions <em>in relation to each other</em>.</p>

<p>A bigger problem occurs when an individual is inconsistent in his ratings over time. If an individual rates everything low for a while, then rates everything high, then he has a greater chance of biasing the overall rating pool. Worse, his individual ratings aren't meaningful, because you can't look at two items, see that one is a "6" and another is an "8", and truly believe that he likes the "8" a fair amount more than the "6". This reduces the usability of an individual recommendation system or a friends system where one user might look at what other users thought about products, because their unaggregated numbers are not accurate.</p>

<p>You thus want to help individuals to stay consistent, and the best way to do that is to make the criteria for your ratings distinct. <a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com>BoardGameGeek</a>, a board game web site that supports a 10-point rating system for games, does a good job of offering distinction in its ratings. </p>

<blockquote><p><a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/settlers_rating_1.png alt=Settlers_rating_1 title=Settlers_rating_1 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>

</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>10</strong> - Outstanding. Always want to play and expect this will never change.</li>
<li><strong>9 </strong>- Excellent game. Always want to play it.</li>
<li><strong>8 </strong>- Very good game. I like to play. Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game.</li>
<li><strong>7 </strong>- Good game, usually willing to play.</li>
<li><strong>6 </strong>- Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood.</li>
<li><strong>5 </strong>- Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it.</li>
<li><strong>4 </strong>- Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion.</li>
<li><strong>3 </strong>- Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad.</li>
<li><strong>2 </strong>- Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again.</li>
<li><strong>1 -</strong> Defies description of a game. You won't catch me dead playing this. Clearly broken.</ul></blockquote>

<p>If you offer a distinct rating listing like this, some users will still come up with their own rating ideas, but if they do, they're more likely to remember what each number means to them. For everyone else, a very clear, s rating system is the most likely to produce meaningful and consistent results. As long as users aren't puzzled by the distinction, they'll be consistent in picking the same numbers for the same rating every time.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Statistical Ratings</h3>

<p>The last big topic that you have to think about in creating most comparison rating systems is whether they're statistically sound. </p>

<p>The best way to make your ratings statistically sound is with volume. If you can manage thousands or tens of thousands of ratings for each item, any anomolies are going to become noise. However, the fewer ratings you have, the more likely it is that your ratings are inaccurate in relationship to your database of ratings as a whole. (And thus one of the failures for eBay is that it tries to claim meaningfulness for users with very few ratings, where there's clearly no statistical basis.)</p>

<p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes><img border=0 src=../photos/uncategorized/bayes.jpeg alt=Bayes title=Bayes style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
Ideally what you want to do is give items with fewer ratings among your collection less weight, and those with more ratings higher weight. One simple way to do this is to apply a <em>bayesian average</em>. Variants of this are used by the aforementioned BoardGameGeek and by <a href=http://www.imdb.com>IMDB</a>. RPGnet is using it for some unreleased software as well.</p>

<p>The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site, and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings. The basic formula looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><code> b(r) = [ W(a) * a + W(r) * r ] / (W(a) + W(r)]</code>

</p>

<p><code>r</code> = average rating for an item<br><code>W(r)</code> = weight of that rating, which is the number of ratings<br><code> a</code> = average rating for your collection<br> <code>W(a)</code> = weight of that average, which is an arbitrary number, but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items; 100 is used here, for a database which expects many ratings per item<br><code>b(r)</code> = new bayesian rating </blockquote>

<p>Say three "shill" users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a "10" because the producer asked them to. However, you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100, and thus 3 ratings won't move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>b(r) = [100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10] / (100 + 3)<br> b(r) = 680 / 103<br> b(r) = 6.60</code></blockquote>

<p>WowWebDesigns uses a similar model and even offers a <a href=http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/formula.php>good explanation of their methods</a> on their web site.<a href=http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/designs/id_242/ratings/><img src=../photos/uncategorized/wowwebdesignsrating.png alt=Wowwebdesignsrating style="margin: 5px;" class=image-full border=0 halign=middle title=Wowwebdesignsrating></a>
</p>

<p>With everything that's been described thus far, including granularity and distinction, a bayesian average (or some other similiar method) will probably be enough to give your ratings a good, sound statistical basis. However, sites with low volume of ratings may still be concerned with "shills" or "crappers" who come in to your site just to put "10"s on their favorite items on "1"s on their least favorite. RPGnet's reviews are an example of a site that could experience this issue, because only a few people are going to ever write reviews for an individual item, and this small number of reviews could compromise the nature of any comparisons generated by the ratings sytems.</p>

<p>In short summary the following additional methods may help with this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rate the Raters:</strong> Reviews are low volume, but presumably readers of those reviews are high volume, and you can take advantage of that to then have your readers rate the reviews. <a href=http://www.amazon.com>Amazon</a> and <a href=http://www.netflix.com>Netflix</a> are two examples of sites which use this method by asking "how many readers found this helpful".</li>

<li><p><strong>Altruistic Punishment:</strong> An alternative method for rating raters is to use <a href=../2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html#altruistic_punishment>altruistic punishment</a>. Herein users can punish someone who does contribute to the community, but at a cost to themselves. So, a reader could flag a poor rating or a poor review at some minor cost to their own rating. Though this method may seems somewhat paradoxical, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory>game theory</a>  suggests that it is a generally effective technique for improving the commons.</p>

</li>

<li><p><strong>Adjust Ratings Based on Ratings:</strong> Ratings can be self-adjusted based upon the rater's own behavior. The simplest method here is to map a rater's average rating to the average rating for a site. For example, if the average rating of a site is 6.50 and a shill's average rating is 10.0, then those 10s should be treated as 6.50s. This has the possibility for some intensive calculations, however, and may lead to additional bias in your rating pool if shills figure out the methods you use to adjust ratings.
</li>

<li><p><strong>Allow Editorial Fiat:</strong> Another method is to allow editorial fiat, where editors are expected to come in and remove bad ratings (or proactively not release them). This clearly results in time issues, but they may not be major since only sites with small numbers of ratings/item will have to do this type of adjusting. Further, automated systems could flag "suspicious" rating patterns which are outside the norms for average, speed of rating, etc. (RPGnet supports editorial fiat by requiring editorial release of all reviews.)</ul>

<p>The idea of adjusting ratings based on ratings bears a bit of additional discussion because it's somewhat similar to another well-knowing rating system: slashdot. Herein you have both ratings and meta-ratings. People can rate threads and articles, then other people can agree or disagree with those ratings, which in turn makes it more or less likely that the original rater will be allowed to rate in the future (depending on if people agree or disagree with his ratings). Under a more general classification, this is probably a <em>meta-rating system based on a reputation system</em>, so it's something we'll look at further a couple of articles down the road.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Issues: Bilateralism &amp; Usefulness</h3>

<p>90% of the rating issues that sites will face are covered by the above. However eBay in particular raised two other issues -- bilateralism and usefulness -- that aren't as generally relevant but do deserve some consideration.</p>

<p><strong><a href=../photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg><img src=../photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg alt=Ebayfeedback style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" class=image-full border=0 title=Ebayfeedback></a>
Bilateralism:</strong> One of the reasons that eBay's ratings fall apart is that they're bilateral. Buyers and sellers rate each other simultaneously and thus there's the fear of revenge if you rate someone badly. It's a sufficient issue that eBay has a <a href=http://pages.ebay.com/help/feedback/questions/retaliatory-feedback.html>FAQ on the topic</a>, though they don't offer any good answers. </p>

<p>The following solution would address some issues of bilateral revenge:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Put a time limit on bilateral ratings</li>
<li><p>Release bilateral ratings simultaneously at the end of the time limit</li>
<li><p>Don't allow additional ratings after the time period</li>
</ul>

<p>This would work well on an eBay, where you're unlikely to conclude an additional deal with someone you rated badly, and thus there's no possibility ever for rating revenge. On a game site, however, where people are arbitrarily put into games with each other, and thus you could end up in a game with someone you rated poorly, there might be room for later revenge, down the road. This would have to be addressed to truly feel comfortable with bilateral ratings. </p>

<p>Additional investigation might reveal more variations of this method, or offer good answers for alternatives, like <em>anonymous ratings</em>.</p>

<p>In addition, good privacy restrictions are really needed to make bilateral ratings work, as well as Terms of Service that protect users from lawsuits for ratings. There have already been cases of physical threats based upon eBay ratings. eBay has also produced cases where people threatened slander or libel lawsuits for bad ratings, and this even further chills the possibility of true ratings appearing on the eBay server.</p>

<p><strong>Usefulness:</strong> Finally, you want to make sure your ratings are useful at your sites. Rankings are a good way to achieve this. You can see the "best games ever" ranked, or you can see the most interesting user content rise to the top of a long listing, and the least interesting sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>eBay offers a counter example of frustration with the usefulness of ratings. As already mentioned, you can theoretically ban "bad" users from bidding on your items, and then cancel bids from these users if they appear. However, there are multiple issues with this approach. First, how do you define "bad" users on eBay? Insufficient feedback? Too much negative feedback? Too high a percentage of negative feedback? Second, there is no automated method for doing this, so you must remain ever vigilant on your auctions to make sure that "bad" users aren't involved. Third, there's no way to keep a bad bidder from returning after you've cancelled his bid. Fourth, these bad bids and cancellations have the possibility of corrupting your auction, as you could lose other bidders who came in, saw the higher bid when the bad bidder was involved, then left before the bid was reduced by his removal. Finally, greed is a powerful motivator on eBay, which might lead to the retention of bad users.</p>

<p>You also need to be careful with your user interface for ratings. Here is an example of a poor UI:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Comparison ratings are going to be an increasingly important force as the Internet continues to mature. To produce meaningful comparison ratings for your site, you need to concentrate on four important factors: granularity, specifity, sound statistics, and usefulness. And, if you offer bilateral ratings, make sure you understand the subtleties of that as well.</p>
