                                <p>While I've been out attending the <a href=http://www.sxsw.com>SXSW Music, Movie and Interactive Conference</a> there has been a flurry of high-quality postings about Social Networking.</p>

<p>Unlike many of my fellow bloggers, I find it difficult to post meaningful blogs while I'm on the road. It has been my policy in my own blog postings to also be "high-signal, low-noise", so normally I don't just post links without solid additional commentary, however, I'm making an exception this time because of the quality and depth of these entries.</p>

<h4>How Do We Categorize Relationships</h4>

<p>Clay Shirky writes in Many to Many <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/03/16/relationship_a_vocabulary_for_describing_relationships_between_people.php>RELATIONSHIP: A vocabulary for describing relationships between people</a> which is a commentary on a new proposal for <a href=http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/>mapping relationships</a> in <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a> (see also my previous blog on <a href=../../../2004/02/handcrafting_my.html>FOAF</a>):<p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Here, just in case you were wondering, is how you should be characterizing your relationships with one another:</p>

<p>friendOf, acquaintanceOf, parentOf, siblingOf, childOf, grandchildOf, spouseOf, enemyOf, antagonistOf, ambivalentOf, lostContactWith, knowsOf, wouldLikeToKnow, knowsInPassing, knowsByReputation, closeFriendOf, hasMet, worksWith, colleagueOf, collaboratesWith, employerOf, employedBy, mentorOf, apprenticeTo, livesWith, neighborOf, grandparentOf, lifePartnerOf, engagedTo, ancestorOf, descendantOf, participantIn, participant</p>

</i><p><i>Describing relationships with a controlled vocabulary can sound credible right up to the moment you see the vocabulary, but this thing is a mess.<br>
...<br>
The RELATIONSHIP list should make it obvious that explicit linguistic clarity in human relations is a pipe dream. It probably won’t though — the madness of the age is to assume that people can spell out, in explicit detail, the messiest aspects of their lives, and that they will eagerly do so, in order to provide better inputs to cool new software.
</i></blockquote>

<p>Make sure you read the comment's in Clay Shirky's blog entry -- some good discussion.</p>

<p>Ian Davis writes a response to Clay's posting in <a href=http://internetalchemy.org/2004/03/clayShirkyOnRELATIONSHIP>Clay Shirky on Relationship</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>There are a number of themes in Clay's post. The primary theme appears to be one of completeness: Clay's thesis is that the vocabulary is incomplete because it doesn't provide properties to model composite relationships: what if you are employed by a colleague you collaborate with?. Clay seems to be implying that he expects the terms to be exclusive. Of course they're not. It's perfectly meaningful to assert that Jane employedBy John and Jane collaboratesWith John. RDF supports this kind of assertion and you can also express it with the HTML method outlined in the vocabulary.<br>
...<br>
Obviously I'm pleased that Clay has taken the vocabulary seriously enough to critique in detail. Somehow the thought that everyone would ignore it caused me more concern than the fear that everyone would hate it.</p>

<p>Despite all the obvious thought Clay put into his piece, he still managed to overlook the raison d'etre for the relationship vocabulary. Indeed it's the raison d'etre for all vocabularies. Without these vocabularies, incomplete and imperfect as they are, we would be mute in the machine readable web, unable to express ourselves in any meaningful way. You only have to look at the etymology to realise that vocabularies give you a voice.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Like Clay I too am concerned with this relationship proposal, for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>First, I'm not sure that I like the "negative" relationships. There is a good argument against using negative relationships in the <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn/background#positive>XFN Background</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Negative relationship terms have been omitted from XFN by design.  The authors think that such values would not serve a positive ends and thus made the deliberate decision to leave them out. Such terms (we won't even bother naming them here) while mildly entertaining in a dark humor sort of way, only serve to propagate negativity.</p>

<p>The authors do not deny that such negative relationships exist in the real world today.  Of course they exist.  However, we see no need nor benefit to standardizing such relationships and capturing them in a form which would spread on the Web.  There is enough hatred in the world.  We should work to eliminate hatred, not to spread it.</p>

<p>And we do realize that by creating <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn>XFN</a> and the mechanisms it uses (<a href=http://gmpg.org/xmdp/>XMDP</a>), we have opened a Pandora's box, and have made it easier for those that would create and propagate negative relationships.  We can only hope that our positive creation wins out over any such negative creations.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Secondly, I am uncomfortable with both the relationships in <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a> and parallel ideas in <a href=http://gmpg.org/xfn>XFN</a> because they in both proposals these are "exposed" publicly. I am comfortable with saying that I "knowOf" someone, but when forced to categorize publicly everyone even more precisely, I become uncomfortable. Am a I committing a faux-pas when I say that I am a "friendOf" someone when they think I'm a "closeFriendOf"?</p>

<p>Lastly, I'm concerned about complexity -- once you start down the slippery slope of defining relationships, things can get incredibly complex. Even if don't include concerns about ethnocentricity (as <a href=http://www.michael.bauser.name/20031225T045828Z>Michael Bauser writes</a>), there just seems to be no end in sight to how specific you might be required to be. Becoming more specific typically results in more precision, but in this case, as these are very fluid human (or even primate) definitions, wrought with emotion, may result in them being less precise. Maybe the real answer should be much simpler four: knowsOf, professionalColleagueOf, personalFriendOf, and shareFamilyWith.</p>

<h4>Are Social Networks Useful?</h4>

<p>Judith Meskill asks in <a href=http://www.meskill.net/archives/000565.html>Musings On Autonomic Social &amp; Knowledge Networks</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>If you utilize one or more of the current entrants in this swell of online SNS offerings [such as LinkedIn, Friendster, Orkut, Ryze, and/or Tribe] - what value, if any, do you derive from them? And, harkening back to the citation with which I started this post, has one [or more] of these services assisted in helping you to successfully reduce the 'traffic congestion' at the 'intersections' in your life? And, in closing, any insights, comments, or ponderings on the recent and future blurring of lines between 'wetware,' 'software,' and 'hardware' in an infinitely connected wireless world?</i></blockquote>

<p>Stuart Henshall answers in Unbound Spiral <a href=http://www.henshall.com/blog/archives/000817.html>Social Networking is Broken</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>This slightly facetious statement: "My social networks are broken... at least I think they are." reflects my conclusion that the social networks I've been playing in are for the most part associative networks. While they have a social element the socializing for the most part takes place by blogs, forums, IM / e-mail, phone and in face to face visits.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It's time to put a stop to categorizing these "things" as social networks. Call them "Associative Networking Tools" or "Structured Association Tools" or something similar. Then you can create a bucket for them. The reason there is no real business model is they are just part of / or component towards building our capabilities to enhance "presence" and connectivity.</p>

<p>What have we learned.</p>

<ul><li>We don't socialize rather only associate through the Orkuts while we socialize using messaging, telephone and face to face visits.</li>

<li>The opportunity to connecting through friends is much greater than generally understood. Some successes have been achieved. </li>

<li>Virtual connections mean managing ones connections and presence has never been more important. </li>

<li>Structured services are creating problems where there were none before. From categories to access. And designating "artificial" forced levels of buddies or friendship.</li>

<li>Fragmenting association systems does not enable better connections.</li> 

<li>Integration on to my desktop (address book / IM systems) at minimum and preferably into my cellphone is required for there are few you can synch with and while one can upload addresses you can seldom download. </li>

<li>The sites themselves are seldom responsible for the association, the connective knowledge is broader than the networking sites. eg blogs, blogrolls, online forums etc.</ul>

Denise Klarquist writes in <a href=http://weblog.cheskin.net/blog/archives/000216.html>SNAM - Too much of a good thing?</a> (via <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a394>Dinah Mehta</a>):

<blockquote><i>Each time I'm invited to join or add someone (frequently unknown to me) to my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/>Linkedin</a> network, or asked to update my contact information via <a href=http://www.plaxo.com/>Plaxo</a> (again, usually by someone I barely know) I wonder how far my online social network extends. And how useful it really is. I'm still intrigued and excited by the possibilities of online social networking. But I'm hoping to see more of the benefits before the noise dampens my enthusiasm.</i></blockquote>

<p><a href=http://www.chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/>Chris Corrigan</a> offers a similar concern in a comment in Dinah Mehta's blog <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a395>Social Networking - Too Much Noise?</a>:

<blockquote><i>
<p>"Seems to me that social networks have a hard time existing in the absence of a reason to do so. I have played around on Ryze and Orkut and to be honest they hold no glamour for me. I have a number of real life social networks from whence my business comes, and my weblog provides me with another social network from which I derive a lot of learning.</p>

<p>But I could never find a reason for the Ryze's and Orkuts of the world. And without a reason to network, networking becomes just noise.</p>

<p>One application for these types of things that I am working with a little is using social networking software to support emerging Aboriginal leaders here in British Columbia Canada who are working on interesting things in remote and far flung communities and who will really benefit from have some contact with each other. </p>

<p>But I wouldn't dream of inviting them to Ryze. Interesting, eh?"</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>Lately I've been noticing the spread of a meme regarding "Dunbar's Number" of 150 that I believe is misunderstanding of his ideas.</p>

<h3>The Science of Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Dunbar is an anthropologist at the University College of London, who wrote a paper on <a href=http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/05/65/bbs00000565-00/bbs.dunbar.html>Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans</a> where he hypothesizes:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... there is a cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships, that this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this in turn limits group size ... the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained.</em></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar supports this hypothesis through studies by a number of field anthropologists. These studies measure the group size of a variety of different primates; Dunbar then correlate those group sizes to the brain sizes of the primates to produce a mathematical formula for how the two correspond. Using his formula, which is based on 36 primates, he predicts that 147.8 is the "mean group size" for humans, which matches census data on various village and tribe sizes in many cultures. The following chart shows the distribution produced by Dunbar's analysis:</p>

<p align=center><img src=http://www.bcg.com/images/this_is_bcg/strategy_institute/brain_size_02.gif><br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Source: <a href=http://www.bcg.com/strategy_institute_gallery/gorilla3.asp>Boston Consulting Group</a></span></p>

<p>This number of 150 has become "Dunbar's Number" and has been popularized by various very popular business books such as Malcolm Gladwell's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a> (<a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0111705/categories/collaboration/2003/12/21.html#a358>summary</a>), Duncan J. Watts' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041425/ref=pd_skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age</a> (<a href=http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/reviews/Podolny/>review</a>) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691005419/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Small Worlds: The Dynamics of Networks between Order and Randomness</a> (<a href=http://www.ams.org/notices/200008/rev-chow.pdf>review</a>), and Mark Buchanan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041530/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks</a> (<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/16209;jsessionid=baadd3W3trYipI">review</a>), the ideas from which are the foundation of the various Social Network Services that I've discussed elsewhere in this blog.</p>

<h3>Revisiting Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Lately, Dunbar's number has been taken as a mean size for online networks and groups, as shown in <a href=http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/02/12.html#a284>Ross Mayfield's Weblog</a>, where he states:

<blockquote>
<table border=1><tr>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Network</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Size</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Description</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Distribution</span></strong></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Political Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~1000s</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as mass media</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Power-law (scale-free)</span></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Social Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~150</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogging Classic</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Bell-curve (random)</span></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Creative Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~12</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as dinner conversation</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Dense (equal)</span></table>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Dunbar's work itself suggests that a community size of 150 will not be a mean for a community unless it is highly incentivized to remain together. We can see hints of this in Dunbar's description of the number and what it means:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The group size predicted for modern humans by equation (1) would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.<br>
...<br>
My suggestion, then, is that language evolved as a "cheap" form of social grooming, so enabling the ancestral humans to maintain the cohesion of the unusually large groups demanded by the particular conditions they faced at the time.</em></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar's theory is that this 42% number would be true for humans if humans had not invented language, a "cheap" form of social grooming. However, it does show that for a group to sustain itself at the size of 150, significantly more effort must be spent on the core socialization which is necessary to keep the group functioning. Some organizations will have sufficient incentive to maintain this high level of required socialization. In fact the traditional villages and historical military troop sizes that Dunbar analyzed are probably the best examples of such an incentive, since they were built upon the raw need for survival. However, this is a tremendous amount of effort for a group if it's trying not just to maintain cohesion, but also to get something done.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Dunbar specifically restricts himself to physically close groups:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.</em></blockquote>

<p>My anecdotal evidence generally seems to support the idea that group sizes will usually plateau at a number lower than 150 participants. This comes from 20 years of doing facilitation both on and offline, running several software companies, and running various forums at America Online. In particular, many online communities provide good evidence for Dunbar's Number actually being an upper limit (either due to reduced efficiency or due to increased dispersion).</p>

<h3><a name=onlinecommunities>Dunbar &amp; Online Communities</a></h3>

<p><em>Ultima Online</em> provides one of the best examples of what sizes an online community will support because it's well documented and the overall game size is large enough to generate many smaller communities. If you look at <a href=http://www.legendmud.org/raph/>Raph Koster's</a> statistics for the size of groups in <em>Ultima Online</em>, you will see a definite point of diminishing returns at around 150; however, you will also see that most groups are around 60 large.</p>

<p>Jessica Mulligan, executive producer at <a href=http://www.turbinegames.com/>Turbine Games</a>, confirmed these numbers to me:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The numbers match up with my (currently) mostly anecdotal evidence for <a href=http://ac.turbingames.com>Asheron's Call</a>.  We have allegiances in the hundreds and even thousands of members, but most of those members are inactive, non-participatory in the group on a regular basis or are mule accounts for farming XP.  It is rare to have more than 40 or so active participants in an Allegiance.</em></blockquote>

<p>I've seen similar limits myself in some of the small online games that <a href=http://www.skotos.com>Skotos</a> produces. For instance, in <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach>Castle Marrach</a>, which is a social-dominant game (i.e. like a MUSH), the game grew quickly until we reached approximately 150-200 active users. However, whenever it grew beyond that number, it always seemed that politics and dissatisfaction would bubble up such that people would drop out, leaving us back close to 150 or 160. (That we would ever exceed 150 is a bit of a surprise, but I think it's due to any number of factors, including a variable 24-hour user base, wherein on a given day we might only see a little more then half of our community members, below Dunbar's Number, and only get up to close to 200 or so over a full week.)</p>

<p>We have had some games at Skotos that do manage to overcome Dunbarrian social limits, prime among them <a href=http://www.skotos.net/games/eternal-city>The Eternal City</a> which regularly exceeds the Marrach community by more then double. However, TEC is a much more achievement-oriented game, meaning that people spend much of their time interacting with the environment -- fighting monsters and training skills as it happens -- rather than directly interacting with other players all the time. Thus social limits become less important.</p>

<p>Other online communities that I've had experience with have been more traditional, and thus more closely met my expectations for Dunbar's Number acting as a limit rather than a mean. When I managed the Mac Developer's Forum community on AOL, a forum would start to break down when it reached about 80 active contributors, requiring a forum split before continued growth could occur. Wikis provide another good example; the WikiPedia, one of the largest active Wikis online, appears to have hovered at approximately 150-175 <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators>active administrators</a> for over a year, in spite of a huge growth in usage during the same period.</p>

<p>These numbers just keep coming up.</p>

<p>This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time "grooming" to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don't have <a href=http://www.doceo.co.uk/background/requisite_variety.htm>requisite variety</a>.</p>

<p>

Thus Dana Boyd gets it right when she uses the word MAXIMUM in her <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/11/my_etech_talk_revenge_of_the_user.html>eTech Talk</a>, not average or mean:

<blockquote><p><em>[Dunbar] found that the MAXIMUM number of people that a person could keep up with socially at any given time, gossip maintenance, was 150. This doesn't mean that people don't have 150 people in their social network, but that they only keep tabs on 150 people max at any given point.</em></blockquote>

<h3>Expanding Dunbar's Numbers</h3>

<p>To open up the discussion a bit, I'd also hypothesize that Dunbar's Number is just one datapoint in an overall equation describing what group sizes work and what don't. Working our way up from the smallest group sizes, I think we can find many break points, both above and below Dunbar's Number of 150.</p>

<p>In my experience the smallest viable group size seems to be somewhere in the range of 5 to 9.</p>

<p>Looking smaller, we see that a group of 2 can be tremendously creative (ask any parent), but often has insufficient resources and thus requires deep commitment by both parties. Notably, often the difficulty of a 2-person business partnership is compared to that of a marriage. A group of 3 is often unstable, with one person feeling left out, or else one person controlling the others by being the "split" vote. A group of 4 often devolves into two pairs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of "team" really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough "attention" is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Although I've been unable to find the source, I've heard of some references to a study from the 1950s that says that the optimum size for a committee is 7. Likewise, it's fairly easy for us to see and agree that a dinner party starts to break down somewhere above 7 or 8 people, as do also tabletop games of both the strategic (I prefer 5) and role-playing varieties (I prefer 7). These size limits can be overcome, but require increased amounts of "grooming". </p>

<p>The chasm that starts somewhere between 9 to 12 people can be especially daunting for a small business. As you grow past 12 or so employees, you must start specializing and having departments and direct reports; however, you are not quite large enough for this to be efficient, and thus much employee time that you put toward management tasks is wasted. Only as you approach and pass 25 people does having simple departments and managers begin to work again, as it starts to really make sense for department heads to spend significant time just communicating and coordinating (and as individual departments become large enough to once again allow for the dynamic exchange of ideas that had previously occurred in the original 5-9 member seed group).</p>

<p>I've already noted the next chasm when you go beyond 80 people, which I think is the point that Dunbar's Number actually marks for a non-survival oriented group. Even at this lower point, the noise level created by required socialization becomes an issue, and filtering becomes essential. As you approach 150 this begins to be unmanageable. Once a company grows past 200 you are really starting to need middle-management, but often you can't afford it yet. Only when you get up past that, maybe at 350-500 people, does middle-management start really working, primarily because you've once again segmented your original departments, possibly again reducing them to Dunbar-sized groups.</p>

<p>The following chart shows anecdotal satisfaction ratings for these lower group sizes:</p>

<p align=center><img src=../../../GroupSatisfaction.jpg alt="Group Satisfaction"></p>

<p>Much of this is probably predicted by Dunbar's model, if you add in the non-survival and dispursed community modifiers that I discuss here. Essentially, as we increase group sizes beyond 80, to 150, 200, or even 350-500, we typically do so by breaking larger groups down into smaller ones, and continually reducing community sizes down to the point where they can be understood and managed by people -- and so efficiency reasserts itself.</p><br>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I spent most of last week at the RSA Conference in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Like last year, I found little that excited me. I overheard from a convention staffer that they had 30% more attendees, so the conference is growing again, but my week there also reinforced my opinions regarding the industry as a whole as I describe in my previous blog posting <a href=../../../2004/02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a>.</p>

<p>I asked a number of random people what they thought of the conference. Some agreed with me, saying that they were troubled by the lack of innovation. Others said that they actually liked it -- it showed that the industry was being run by businessmen finally, and not by geeks. Others said that it was just the inevitable maturation of an industry. Tim Oren wrote in his blog <a href=http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2004/02/27.html#a565>Due Diligence</a>:<blockquote>Every year the show is less about cryptography per se. I'm sure this has something to do with RSA's attempts to diversify as its patents expire, but I do think it reflects the state of the field. Crypto has become a standardized component of security solutions, and the biggest perceived threats are not in the privacy area.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The hilight of the conference to me was hearing respected cryptographer Whitfield Diffie say to me that he had read my <a href=../../../2004/02/security_crypto.html>The Bad Business of Fear</a> and that he liked it. Apparently it had been sent to him by someone at Sun who had thought that it was saying many of the things that Diffie has been saying as well. Diffie said that he had some specific criticisms, so I hope that he'll comment here someday on them.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Caller-ID for Email</h4><p></p>

<p>The big announcement of the week was that Microsoft will be be releasing their own spam solution, a <a href=http://windows-help.net/cgi-bin/2004/7.08.cgi?70801>Caller ID</a> for email addresses, starting this summer in HotMail and in their mail servers. Basically the way this works is that every domain holder publishes inside their DNS records the IP addresses of any valid outbound email server. This information is stored using XML in a special signed format. After a mail is sent, the receiving system queries the DNS to confirm that the outbound server is not being spoofed.</p>

<p>This is a very similar technique to what a number of other companies are proposing, for instance AOL is backing a proposal called <a href=http://spf.pobox.com/execsumm.html>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> or sometimes "Sender Permitted From", and Yahoo is backing <a href=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1430976,00.asp>Domain Keys</a>. Unfortunately, Microsoft's Caller-ID proposal requires XML, which makes implementation much more complicated. It requires the entire email to be received by the server first, before looking up the DNS record, then validating a signature -- all of which introduces more burdens on the mail server. Lastly, this XML may exceed the 512-character limit for DNS requests, which can cause DNS servers to send via TCP rather then UDP, which may introduces even more uncertainty.</p>

<p>It is good to see that Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo are taking spam seriously, but I do worry that that the burden of supporting more then one of these standards may be significant. This could mean that only large corporations, educational institutions, and ISPs could host email, whereas small companies, third-world organizations, and individuals could not. I would prefer that one solution be broadly and easily adopted. <font color=red><s>Daniel Goldman</s></font> <font color=green>Yakov Shafranovich</font> in <a href=http://www.shaftek.org/blog/archives/000061.html>NetWizard's blog</a> is also concerned about patent claims and lack of IETF participation:<blockquote>At the same time none of these proposals have been submitted to any standards bodies such as the <a href=http://www.ietf.org>IETF</a>, and as a matter of fact <a href=https://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/asrg/current/msg09082.html>Microsoft was invited</a> to submit "Caller ID" and participate in <a href=http://www.ietf.org/ietf/04mar/marid.txt>this week's meeting at the IETF on the subject</a>, but <a href=http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg00023.html>they declined</a>. At the same time the community had jumped on Caller ID's patent license by declaring a (and <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/02/26/1448253&amp;mode=thread">a possible incompatibility with the GPL</a>). Of course it remains to be seen what exactly does Caller ID claim to patent since RMX and other prior art existed at least since 1998, and if Caller ID ever makes it to the IETF, Microsoft will have to deal with <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3669.txt>the new IPR guidelines (RFC 3669)</a> which favor non-patented technologies.</blockquote>I'm also not convinced that even if these techniques are deployed (Gartner group <a href=http://informationweek.securitypipeline.com/news/18201583>predicts</a> less then 25% will implement these in the next two years) that they will not return us to early 1990's levels of spam, only just slow down the onslaught. For instance, in a similar fashion to current WiFi war-chalking, a spammer could wait until an authenticated user logged in a mail server and hijack that connection. Unless the link is encrypted and authenticated, it is possible for a spammer to impersonate the legitimate user without anyone being the wiser. Related, these techniques do not necessarily help with the growing threat of "phishing" -- emails that lure unsuspecting users to enter credit card or bank account information into fake web sites.<p></p>

<p>I am also concerned that all of these standards require some measure of public-key infrastructure, including management of public-keys, which many security analysts believe that we are not doing a good enough job now.</p>

<p>There is some good thoughtful analysis of these three standards by Larry Seltzer of eWeek in <a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,1761,a=120536,00.asp">Who will Win the SMTP Authentication Wars</a>.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>More Security in Windows XP SP2</h4><p></p>

<p>Bill Gates also discussed new security features in the upcoming Windows XP SP2. In addition to some interesting "Active Protection Technology" to prevent overflow attacks, he discussed built-in virus protection and an improved built-in firewall that also warns of outbound connections.</p>

<p>Out in the hall I heard some people saying that announcement was a good basis for selling Symantec short, while others countered that Microsoft never gets these type of things right and there would always be business for Symantec. Companies that offer more minor features like preventing browser popups will be hurt. However, as these solutions are already free and ubiquitous, this is one of the few cases where I prefer for these to be in the default Microsoft install. However, I do worry for the smaller but more innovative security vendors like ZoneAlarm.</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Sessions</h4><p></p>

<p>Over the years the sessions at RSA have become more managerial and corporate in nature, but there were a couple of good technical sessions that I attended or friends commented on.</p>

<p>I was pleased by the Cryptographer's Panel response to Bill Gates' announcements: "We have a lot of great levers in cryptography, but we're missing the OSes and platforms that can really serve our keys," said Ronald Rivest. "Bill Gates didn't talk about simplifying things, but that's the only way we are going to get security. We're not smart enough to handle the complexity of this stuff. You have to get the complexity out of there," continued Paul Kocher. Whitfield Diffie criticized security the upcoming Windows Longhorn release because "For the first time, you will have a PC that does NOT do what you tell it to." </p>

<p>The Cryptographer's Panel also spoke on the topic of electronic voting, and supported calls for paper ballots to supplement and verify votes cast with new electronic voting technology. Rivest cautioned "We know only too well the difficulties of securing complex electronic systems."</p>

<p>I also heard good things about the "Hacking VM Machines" and "Analyzing Topologies of Trust" sessions, and the closing keynote by PJ O'Rouke, but I missed them -- anyone have any notes? Where there some other good sessions I missed?</p>

<p><br>
<h4>Exhibits</h4><p></p>

<p>The exhibit floor was again a bit droll for me.  Like in previous years the floor was dominated by vendors selling rather high-end corporate systems that might have excited me more if I was in the market for one, but I was looking for less expensive systems for smaller businesses. Like last year there were lots of dedicated devices, such as firewalls, spam prevention, VPN and intrusion detection hardware, and fewer companies offering software to use with my existing hardware.</p>

<p>I did like some of the biometric hard drives, but investigating more deeply I just can't trust them yet. No one yet offers a good solution for redundant key storage yet for these, as a backup in case of a physical failure.</p>

<p>I did see one company <a href=http://www.authenex.com>Authenex</a> that was offering free USB keys that supposedly allow you to encrypt files on your system and email them to someone else with a different key -- it looks like some public key technique is being used, with the key serving as a pre-generated private key storage. More interestingly, they claim that if you register your USB key at their website, they can send you a replacement key that you can use to decrypt your old files. I'll have to do some more investigation of the technology behind this, and if they've had adequate study by cryptographers that I trust. If they have, and they start offering storage on those keys as well, they may have something useful that I'll buy.</p>

<p>RSA had an demo of it's <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/company/news/releases/pr.asp?doc_id=3376">prototype RFID blocker tag</a> that they suggest is a possible solution to some of the fears that some of us privacy advocates have been worrying about. <a href=http://scottmace.typepad.com/imanager/2004/02/cool_demo_rsa_r.html>Scott Mace</a> has a good description of the demo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each booth visitor selects from one of three demo prescriptions -- "tranquility pills," "wisdom pills," or "happiness pills." (I chose wisdom, naturally.) The RSA Labs crew requests a name from the visitor, then hands over an appropriately-tagged bottle (mine contained jellybeans). They scan the bottle on an RFID tabletop scanner and visitors see the details of the prescription, including type of prescription and patient's name. Then, they insert the bottle into an ordinary paper pharmacy bag that happens to contain a paper "blocker tag" that then blocks any attempt for an RFID reader to scan the bottle while it's in the bag.</blockquote><p>
Though a cool demo, I'm not as confident that this solution will work. Now in addition to the previous "foil bag" theft techniques, what prevents someone from building one of these into a watch or a PDA? Sending a signal to burn-out the RFID is one of the other proposals out there, it has similar problems -- what if someone goes into a WalMart and burns-out every RFID in the place?

<p>RSA was also demoing its latest SecurID integration with Windows, which will extend the life of this security token for RSA customers for many years. I spoke to Scott Schnell, VP of Marketing, afterwards at a party and he explained to me some of the details of how they made it work with Windows laptops. Apparently the system will cache up to several weeks worth of SecurID information such that the laptop owner can use his SecurID token to log on to his laptop even though he is not connected to the network. I neat trick, though I'd like to see some more security reviews before I'd deploy it broadly.</p>

<p>Probably the most interesting, but least useful to me, was a booth for <a href=http://www.magiqtech.com/>Magiq Technology</a>, who offer a commercial quantum cryptography solution. Quantum cryptography is the ultimate in secret key exchange at a distance -- you can sort of say that the universe protects you from snoopers. However, you have to have a fiber-optic connection between the two devices, which limits its practicality. But it is still cool.</p>

                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>As I head out next week to the <a href=http://2004.rsaconference.com/>RSA Conference</a> I realized that it has been 13 years since I attended the first one. I remember fondly the potential and power of cryptography technology in 1991 -- public keys, digital certificates, new possibilities for privacy, digital cash, etc.</p>

<p>After 8 more years I left the compujter security industry on March 15, 1999. The computer security industry also seemed to be filled with as much potential as it did back in 1991. Amazon, EBay, and other Internet notables were still riding high, and driving before them the need for secure Internet transactions. The government's attempt to cripple the industry through their Clipper chip initiative was all but dead, and we were slowly winning the rights to export our technologies without severe and unnecessary government restrictions. We were beginning to truly see how Certificate Authorities worked in practical usage, and were coming up with plans for smaller, more efficient certs, to help bring security to wireless devices and set-top boxes.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that I left the industry at such a height, but I'd accomplished my own personal goals. I helped midwife the startup of <a href=http://www.verisign.com>VeriSign</a>, and digital certificates were now broadly available for both servers and clients. I'd helped fight Clipper, and freed RSAREF so that it could be used by Open Source software before the expiration of the patent. I'd grown Consensus Development, a company I founded almost a decade before, from a small engineering house into the premiere SSL developer. I'd lead the team that developed the SSL Reference version for Netscape, and had completed the IETF's <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt>RFC 2246</a> that described the future of SSL called TLS.</p>

<p>Thus I found myself at the heart of a burgeoning Internet commerce industry. When <a href=http://www.certicom.com>Certicom</a>, a leading cryptography company, had expressed a desire to purchase my company, I considered the returns for my investors, the value to my employees -- I was pleased with the results, and agreed. So I made an exit from the security industry, and as part of my agreement with Certicom I signed a non-compete which gave them a few years' head start before I dipped my foot back into the security industry. </p>

<p>Now, five years more have gone by. My non-compete with Certicom has expired and for over a year I have slowly been easing my way back into the world of security and cryptography. I must admit, I was a bit uncertain at first. Five years ago I had seen the industry perched on the edge of the next big change. It had been prepared to secure the hundreds of new applications that were proliferating on the net; to broadly adopt TLS, the newest version of SSL; to really look at the practical applications of certificate authorities and recreate the entire concept as a second generation of ideas. I wondered how far behind I would be, if I'd recognize the industry at all. Internet time had still been moving fast back in 1999 and I wasn't sure how many generations had gone by in the security industry. One, two, more?</p>

<p>So last year I started attending security related conferences again, such as <a href=http://www.ietf.org/meetings/meetings.html>IETF Meetings</a>, the <a href=http://2004.rsaconference.com/>RSA Conference</a>, and others. I was ready to come as a student, to soak up the new knowledge imparted in the talks and tutorials, to glory in the changes that the last five years had brought. Instead I discovered, almost nothing had changed. If anything, the industry had been moving backward, just a tiny bit. </p>

<p>What had happened to an industry that just five years ago had been rapidly pushing forward the frontiers of technology? </p>

<p>And, more important, how could it move forward? </p>

<h4>The State of the Industry: Living off of Fear</h4>

<p>Overall, I find the state of the security industry to be a bit sobering for its lack of momentum in recent years. This slowdown can be seen nowhere as easily as upon the exhibit floor of RSA Conference, the premiere conference for this industry, which I attended last year and will attend again next week.</p>

<p>Walking the floors of RSA last year, in the immense exhibit hall at the San Jose Convention Center, I did feel a sense of energy. The floor was still packed, and the carefully cut kiosks and the garish banners bespoke the millions put into the show by the exhibitors. The constant chatter was a deafening white noise, and whenever I veered too near a booth, there was a salesman very eager to tell me about his company's latest and greatest. </p>

<p>But, to a certain extent, that energy felt to me like a facade. There was nothing new; instead all the exhibitors were showing off the same technology that they were displaying five years ago. There was a bit of glitz and some extra chrome, perhaps a carefully redesigned product name, but beyond that there was a weird feeling of deja vu. </p>

<p>There were the same old tools that we've been using to deter hackers since the advent of the Morris Worm way back in 1989: products to detect intruders and safeguard your machines against them; firewalls; and VPNs. Maybe we've gotten a little better at figuring out expert rules, maybe we've improved our user interfaces, but these are slow, gradual upgrades, not quantum leaps.</p>

<p>Email still seems to be the newest battlefield upon which security wars are being fought, and you could find any number of new anti-spam tools at RSA. The Bayesian filters are a new and interesting way to statistically classify spam, but at the core level they're a dynamic outgrowth of keyboard filters that have been around for as long as we've been fighting unsolicited commercial email. RSA's big release of the year, Nightingale, was simply another way to protect sensitive online information, a competitor to Microsoft's Wallet technology. We had the ubiquitous hardware tokens too, and discussion of the recently approved AES encryption standard, but nothing dramatically new and exciting. </p>

<p>I suppose I shouldn't have been too surprised, based on my experiences at IETF a month before. Most of the Security Area working groups were still working on the same problems that they'd been discussing five years before. S/MIME is pushing forward on yet another draft of a standard that has never been broadly deployed. IPSEC is similarly continuing to work on the same problems, now years old. TLS was widely implemented and specified, but not widely adopted -- the world still uses SSL 3.0.</p>

<p>In the last year since those two conferences I had lunch with various professional colleagues that I had lost track of, continued to watch as a bystander the leading edge of security and cryptography.</p>

<p>As I overview the industry I have begun to feel that we'd largely abandoned the most interesting and innovative security techniques that were being discussed just five years ago. What happened to alternative public key infrastructures? What happened to attribute or role certificates? What happened to "authorization" being the next step after "authentication", or separating "security" from "privacy"?</p>

<p>Remarkably, if any of these topics are being considered, they seem to be moving outside of the traditional security industry. Such is the case with <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security">SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language</a>, a branch of XML which seems to be doing some of the only work on attribute certificates.</p>

<p>With so many technologies abandoned utterly, or else given up to another computer fields, we must ask: why are we stagnating, moving backward rather than forward? </p>

<h4>Fear: Outlining the Problem</h4>

<p>I thought, could it be the result of the dot-bomb and subsequent recession? Perhaps that is part of it, but we are in denial unless we face the deeper cause. If we go on as we are the security industry will not recover with the next boom.</p>

<p>The decline of the security industry is based upon a basic disconnect between the business world and the security world. </p>

<p>Within the security industry we base our models of trust upon mathematics. We strive to continually push the envelope by codifying security and improving it. On the other hand the business industry bases its models of trust upon risk. It balances the risk of a bad outcome, the cost of that bad outcome, and the cost of reducing that risk. Even if a system is technically insecure, the business world will accept it if the risk of a security breach is low, the cost of a security breach is low, or the cost of closing that breach is high. </p>

<p>Where our model is mathematics, theirs is economics. These two models worked well in tandem for quite a few years; the need for a security industry was initially obvious because of the totally undefined risks and the potentially high costs that were out there, waiting to be taken advantage of.</p>

<p>But now, years later, we've done our job too well. We've taken all those undefined risks and codified them -- made them real and quantifiable. We've offered real demonstrations of online security through years of ecommerce, and in doing so we've proven lower rates of credit card fraud, and almost total proof from high-cost offline problems like extortion and bad reputation. We've helped fill out business' risk models and so shown when we were necessary and when weren't. </p>

<p>In short, we have dug ourselves into a hole. Thus it shouldn't be surprising that the newer security technologies are stagnating ... because we've carefully, cleverly, and constantly diminished our revenues by staying with a business model in which 'good enough' security will become ever cheaper. We've turned our security business into a cheaper alternative to insurance, where business only pay for security if their insurance premiums would otherwise be too high. As the bulk of the risk is now handled by old, cheap technology, what remains for new sales is not enough to keep us truly innovating.</p>

<p>Recent statistics underline the decreasing value of innovative, new security to businesses. According to the <a href="http://www.gocsi.com/press/20030528.jhtml?_requestid=105732">CSI/FBI 2003 Computer Crime and Security Survey</a>, the annual cost of computer crime has decreased in almost every category. From 2001 to 2003, the cost for theft of proprietary information is down from $151.2M to $70.2M. System penetration by outsiders is down from $19.1M to $2.8M. Insider abuse of network access is down from $35.0M to $11.8M. The only computer crime up in dollar damage inflicted is denial-of-service attacks, a very small part of the security pie. </p>

<p>With costs due to computer crime plunging year after year, clearly companies are not incentivized to put money in new prevention technologies.</p>

<p>To simplify, as long as the risks were unknown, we were in a business feeding off of 'fear' and our security industry 'pie' was growing. But as we and our customers both understand the risks better, and as we get better at mitigating those risks cheaply, this "fear" shrinks and thus the entire 'pie' of the security industry becomes smaller. Yes, new 'threats' keep on coming: denial-of-service, worms, spam, etc., but businesses understanding of past risks make them believe that these new risks can be solved and commodified in the same way.</p>

<p>As the philosophy and culture of the business world is hundreds of years old, going back to at least the Italian merchants of the Renaissance, business isn't going to change its model of how business works. Thus, it is up to us to rework the basic beliefs and understanding of our security industry.</p>

<p>In order to get out of this hole we need to dramatically rethink how we approach, develop, and market security services. To do this requires us to reconsider our own security models, based upon a better understanding of core business models. Some possibilities: </p>

<ol><li><a href=#insurance>Enter the Insurance Business</a></li>
<li><a href=#reliabiliy>Move into Reliability Improvement</a></li>
<li><a href=#enabling>Move into Enabling Technologies</a></ol>

<h4><a name=insurance>Solution #1: Entering the Insurance Business</a></h4>

<p>Entering the insurance business is an old idea. It was once an important part of <a href=http://www.verisign.com>Verisign's</a> business plan, and no doubt of others as well.</p>

<p>At its simplest level, we can enter the insurance business by offering a guarantee against damages with a product. The main benefit of this approach is that it lets us approach security in a more rational and realistic fashion. No longer do we have to engage in an endless quest for improved security, no matter how small the risk. Instead we can assess our risks and prepare ourselves to accept manageable losses. </p>

<p>There are risks implicit in this solution as well. For the most part, those of us in the security industry are unfamiliar with the insurance business model, and thus we're entering particularly uncharted waters. In addition, we need to understand that some losses will be huge and unavoidable, such as was the case with the Code Red worm. We thus need to create business models that are acceptable to our customers, but which do not leave us entirely liable for the next utterly unforeseen worm which gets set loose on the Internet. </p>

<p>There may also be some limitations with this particular model, if the valuations of security companies are too low to insure the losses of a large corporation, such as a GM. </p>

<p>Finally, we need to ask ourselves the question: "What value does insured security provide over simple insurance?" I suspect there are some real values to customers in saved productivity and time, but further market research would be required to truly assess this. </p>

<p>A security company could offset most of these risks by a partnership with an insurance company or another business within the insurance industry. We would need deep reserves and to work together with imaginative actuaries. Together we could offer insurance against the damages of security breaches. We would be the guardians against break-ins and the fixers if they did occur. The insurance company would help estimate risks, collect premiums and pay. </p>

<p>If we chose to go it alone, we could offer risk mitigation services to insurance companies. We would guard and provide disaster mitigation services for a monthly premium. For example, when offering an anti-breakin security system, we could offer a guarantee to rebuild all certified systems if an intrusion does occur. This way we would take some, but not all, of the risks. Perhaps our presence would reduce insurance premiums enough to pay for our fees. </p>

<p>Overall, despite potential risks, I believe that using an insurance model is a strong possibility for the security industry. </p>

<h4><a name=reliability>Solution #2: Improving Reliability</a></h4> 

<p>Some of us in the security business may feel like we are already providing reliability, because many of our products prevent catastrophic risks due to break-in, theft, and other malevolent acts. However, what we generally tend to offer is data security, not data reliability. Perhaps paradoxically, at the more personal, day-to-day level, the security industry has actually reduced data reliability in the name of improved data security. </p>

<p>I can personally testify to this fact because I have, recently, lost data due to security. I encrypted a directory in Windows XP, then was later forced to rebuild my system. Apparently some of the required info to decrypt the directory was stored in some unrecoverable registry entry, because I can no longer access it. The data is totally secure, but also unavailable. </p>

<p>This anecdote isn't unusual for the security industry. Forgotten keys can often cause cryptographic-related data loss. Likewise, VPNs and firewalls introduce single points of failure into networks. </p>

<p>RSA's Nightingale technology of last year is a fairly standard security-based technology. It uses "secret-splitting" technology to divide sensitive data among two different locations, thus removing what RSA calls "a single point of compromise"; you can't get access to the data unless you compromise two machines. Clearly, there is improved data security. However it raises the same old problem of data reliability, because now data can be lost if either of two servers is lost. </p>

<p>Improving reliability of extant security protocols is a good move forward in this expansion of the industry. For example in a classic cryptography situation we might unlock data with multiple secrets, but only require a set number of those secrets to unlock the data, not all of them.</p>

<p>Consider a company who is encrypting some of their most sensitive sales and marketing data. Ten company officers might each possess a secret which together can be used to decrypt all the data. However, this introduces a clear reliability problem, as the departure of any officer could leave all sales and marketing data unreadable. (Likewise, just restricting this data access to one specific secret, such as that of the VP of Sales, introduces this single-point-of-failure condition.) Instead we could offer a high reliability, but secure situation where any five (of ten) secrets together could decrypt the data. Therefore, if an individual officer disappears, leaves for a rival company, or otherwise makes his secret unavailable, not only can he himself not access the data alone, but even if he leaves with the secret the remainder of the company's access is unaffected. And, if a company didn't think that "5 of 10" executive was the right number, they could instead only require "3 of 10" to decrypt the data ... or "7" or "9".</p>

<p>By thinking in this new methodology, by measuring security against reliability, we can offer our customers real choices and let them each choose the level of security that works best for them. </p>

<p>However, the underlying bases of cryptography let us go a step further than this. Even without considering security implications, we can make use of our existing cryptographic algorithms in order to allow for more reliable access to and retrieval of all sorts of data. In other words, we can offer protection against not just hackers, but also backup errors, system crashes, and other catastrophic failures that are actually much more likely to affect the average user than an Internet security breach is. </p>

<p><a href=http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ips-charter.html>iSCSI</a>, a remote SCSI protocol, offers very good potential for interaction with cryptography. A redundancy caching technique, somewhat like RAID 5, could be integrated with a secret share system where, e.g., the data could be read as long as 80% of the remote drives (and thus their keys) could be accessed; this allows for a very high reliability storage system because individual storage drives could be distantly located, and at the same time uses cryptographic techniques to offset reliability problems that could potentially be caused by the uncertain and fluid nature of Internet connectivity. </p>

<p>Even issues like load balancing and methods to deal with machine down-time might all be improved by some of our cryptographic techniques.</p>

<h4><a name=enabling>Solution #3: Leaving Behind Fear</a></h4>

<p>In talking about insurance and reliability I feel like I'm largely expanding upon a fairly well-known and conservative way of using cryptography. These are good first steps for companies that wish to move forward in a cryptography market that is shrinking due to our own success, but they're not necessarily enough for a major breakout into revenue sources that will make this once again an exciting industry from a business point of view.</p>

<p>What is required, I believe, is a major paradigm shift. We need to leave the whole business of fear behind and instead embrace a new model: using cryptography to enable business rather than to prevent harm. We need to add value by making it possible to do profitable business in ways that are impossible today. There are, fortunately, many cryptographic opportunities, if we only consider them. </p>

<p>Cryptography can be used to make business processes faster and more efficient. With tools derived from cryptography, executives can delegate more efficiently and introduce better checks and balances. They can implement improved decision systems. Entrepreneurs can create improved auction systems. Nick Szabo is one of the few developers who has really investigated this area, through his work on <a href=http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_9/szabo/>Smart Contracts</a>. He has suggested ways to create digital bearer certificates, and has contemplated some interesting secure auctioning techniques and even digital liens. Expanding upon his possibilities we can view the ultimate Smart Contract as a sort of Smart Property. Why not form a corporation on the fly with digital stock certificates, allow it to engage in its creative work, then pay out its investors and workers and dissolve? With new security paradigms, this is all possible. </p>

<p>Federated identity is another area for potential expansion. Secure, federated identities could offer many benefits for consumers. Imagine being able to visit a third-party seller on the Internet, automatically charge a sale to your Amazon account, then automatically ship it to your standard address, all through a single secured identity token. Federated network identity also has real applicability in the business world, as is shown by the work being done by <a href=http://www.projectliberty.org/>Liberty Alliance</a>. Through a business system like this, an auto parts manufacturer could offer his products to General Motors as part of a larger bid, all without having to specifically arrange identity with GM itself. </p>

<p>However, there are notable challenges in the area of federated identity -- challenges which a new-paradigm security industry could lead the way in solving. Distinctions must be made regarding various levels of identity security, so that, e.g., your VPN couldn't be accessed if someone gained access to your Amazon password. In addition there are real concerns from users about controlling their user information, due to worries over spam and privacy; some users, for examples, might not want information about their politics, sexuality, or interests federated with information about their family or job. For instance do we really want our information on <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> to be used by <a href=http://www.google.com>Google</a>?. These challenges demonstrate why federated identity is still a leading edge possibility for the security industry.</p>

<p>Beyond business processes and federated identity there are many other areas that the security industry should be considering, as it moves beyond the business of fear. The whole idea of Public Key Infrastructures should perhaps be rethought, and maybe we should resuscitate lost technologies such as Attribute Certificates, and some of the ideas such as local name spaces as in described Rivest's <a href=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/sdsi.html>SDSI</a>. There are also some interesting possibilities for trusted peer-to-peer environments that can be dynamically expanded on the fly. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination, if we can just think beyond current possibilities.</p>

<p>We have already seen the first wave of security technology; now we need to initiate a second, for I believe with the next wave the best is yet to come.

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>While at <a href=http://etech.weblogsinc.com/>eTech</a>, I attended a number of "social software" sessions. One thing I heard was a persistent call from folk like <a href=http://blogs.it/0100198/>Marc Canter</a> for all the vendors to support something called <a href=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>FOAF</a>. FOAF is a standard for "Friend of a Friend" files, and is an attempt to make <em>machine readable</em> information about people, groups, companies, and other online resources. In particular, it is focused on representing the information that you might typically put on your personal home page in a form such that meta-data tools can interpret it.</p>

<p>If you are using the blog service <a href=http://www.typepad.com>TypePad</a> or the social networking service <a href=http://www.ecademy.com>Ecademy</a> you may already have a FOAF file without knowing it, and <a href=http://www.tribe.net>Tribe.Net</a> announced at eTech that they were promising to support it as well for their social networking service.</p>

<p>FOAF as a standard is still in a fairly primitive state -- to me it feels like HTML did during the days of the early Mosaic browser, when every good web page had to be hand-crafted in a text editor and uploaded to a server. However, like HTML, it may have great promise.</p>

<p>The first thing that FOAF may offer us is a way to exchange information between various social networking services. For instance, I just exported all my <a href=http://www.orkut.com>Orkut</a> friends into my own FOAF file by hand, but there are those who are working on tools to do this automatically, and once Tribe offers FOAF, services like Orkut may be forced to do the same.</p>

<p>Probably more important in the long run is that FOAF may decentralize the data that you make public about yourself -- to put the data under your own control. Owned by you rather then owned by the services you use. For instance, many people have <a href=http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/35375.html>complained about Orkut's ownership of information</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with FOAF right now is that it doesn't support very much "progressive disclosure" or privacy. Progressive disclosure is how people typically handle private information -- they disclose information about themselves a bit at a time, and as trust builds, offer more. The only small measure of privacy that FOAF has is that it has a way to obscure email addresses so that they can't easily be harvested by spammers. But all your other information is totally public. Theoretically you can <a href=http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles>encrypt your FOAF</a> file, but this method requires external PGP-based encrypted files. There is also the possibility of <a href=http://www.w3.org/Signature/>XML-DSIG</a>, however, I find this standard to also be extremely cumbersome right now. <a href=http://www.plaxo.com>Plaxo</a> is a major social networking service that has some excellent <a href=http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/000007.html>comments on FOAF privacy</a> and other issues.</p>

<p>What I want is something that allows people to make 'local' assertions about themselves and their friends, and be able to have those friends be able to 'discover' more information by using those assertions. Ron Rivest came out with an interesting method for this in an old project called <a href=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sdsi10.html>SDSI - A Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure</a> that I hope will inspire a few FOAF architects someday. To adopt his method for FOAF requires everyone to have a FOAF service script somewhere and not just a data file. But we've seen broad adoption of personal RSS and Trackback services, so I don't think this is a huge obstacle to overcome.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to play around with FOAF take over control of your own public data, I've included detailed information on how to get started in hand-crafting your own FOAF file.</p>

<h4>Hand-Crafting your own FOAF</h4>

<p>First, start with <a href=http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html>FOAF-a-Matic</a>. This is a web form page that will create a very simple starting FOAF file for you. Don't put any information in it that you don't want to be public, and skip the section on "people you know". When it asks for your email address, make sure to enter it in all lower-case. When completed, it will look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"

    &lt;foaf:name&gt;Christopher Allen&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
    &lt;foaf:title&gt;Mr&lt;/foaf:title&gt;
    &lt;foaf:firstName&gt;Christopher&lt;/foaf:firstName&gt;
    &lt;foaf:surname&gt;Allen&lt;/foaf:surname&gt;
    &lt;foaf:nick&gt;Chris&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
    &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;9ee1c03552f22e89592ce583be0ab8db0c4f2c59&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;

    &lt;foaf:workInfoHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/&gt;
  &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>The next thing is to add pointers to any other FOAF files that you might have on other services, for instance, I have a profile on Marc Canter's <a href=http://peopleaggregator.com/>People Aggregator</a> service. You should also list the place where you plan on making your FOAF file available -- you might think that this is a circular reference, but it is OK. My convention is to put the most "authoritative" FOAF file last, so that if there is a conflict the last one might override earlier ones. However, in practice I've not found that any FOAF tool I've used supports this convention. Put these right above the closing <code>&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;<code> tag.</code></code></p><code><code>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=102" /&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=network&amp;amp;op=foafrdf&amp;amp;uid=42230" /&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf" /&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now upload your file to your own web site, and then run your FOAF file through two different validators, the first being the <a href=http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/>W3C RDF Validation Service</a>. It will tell you if you've made any mistakes with the RDF aspect of the file. Then use <a href=http://sw1.ilrt.org/discovery/2003/08/validation/>Rosco</a> which will also look at your schema and make recommendations as to missing items. Unfortunately, neither validator is very good at telling you what the problem is if it finds one -- again, it is like the old hand-coding HTML days when you are debugging your web pages.</p>

<p>Once you've got your basic FOAF file working, now to enter your friends. First, add to your <code>foaf:Person</code> the following:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:knows rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This is a pointer that says "look in this document for a person with the <code>rdf:nodeID</code> of MarcCanter". You can invent any value you want for this ID, mcanter, mark, canter, etc., however, it must be a unique ID on this page.</p>

<p>Then fill out the following template for each person, putting below your own <code>foaf:Person</code> but above the closing <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=""&gt;
  &lt;foaf:name&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:firstname&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:surname&gt;&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:nick&gt;&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="" /&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>So for instance with Marc Canter:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"&gt;
  &lt;foaf:name&gt;Marc Canter&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;41e872618d70ba18a7af715083f522afe7fc3238&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=4" /&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now <code>foaf:firstname</code>, <code>foaf:surname</code>, and <code>foaf:nick</code> are not absolutely essential -- you can remove them if they are not needed. I tend to only use them when there might be some confusion, for instance, for "Arthur De Boies" has "De Boise" is a surname, and "Lori Ann Miller" has "Lori Ann" as a firstname. <code>foaf:nick</code> is useful in situatations where there is a dimunitive involved, for instance "Christopher Allen" has "Chris" as a nick, and <code>foaf:nick</code> is also used by some programs online personas or for IRC chat, such as "ChristopherA".</p>

<p>Now where did the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> come from? The purpose of this number is to obscure the email address so that it can't be harvested by spammers, yet is unique enough that it can FOAF-based applications can find people. To convert an email address to a <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> you can use <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/>sha1ify</a>. Just enter the email address that you want converted in all lower case, and copy the string it generates to the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can search and see if any existing FOAF profiles exist for your friend at <a href=http://eikeon.com/foaf/>FOAF: Web View</a>, using their email address. If the friend does have a FOAF file, add it to <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> tag.</p>

<p>When you are done, test your FOAF file with the two validators, and if it works. One common problem that the validators will fail to give you a good error message about is if any of the URLs you use contain any improper characters like &amp; - in particular, Ecademy's FOAF files use this character. Just substitute &amp;amp; for every occurrence of &amp; and it should work fine. Another problem is if any of your friends have international characters in their names, for instance "Sébastien". To avoid this problem, put the following at the top of your FOAF file above your <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag.</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once everything is working you can submit it to services like <a href=http://eikeon.com/foaf/>FOAF: Web View</a>. You can also browse your FOAF file directly by using <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/>FOAF Explorer</a>, or import it into services like <a href=http://peopleaggregator.com>People Aggregator</a>.</p>

<p>Once your FOAF file is working and submitted, you'll want to add an "auto-discovery" meta-tag to your blog or home page. This is placed in the <code>head</code> portion of your HTML code:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml"
  title="FOAF" href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf"/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you are using TypePad, it forces you to use their FOAF file for you unless you used an Advanced Template. With an Advanced Template you can remove the following tags and replace it with the above:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;MTUserIfShow field="foaf"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="&lt;$MTUserSiteURL$&gt;foaf.rdf" /&gt;
  &lt;/MTUserIfShow&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>From this point on it is just a matter of looking at other people's FOAF files and seeing if you want to add any of the other profile properties that they use. I'm trying to keep a well documented foaf at <a href=http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf>http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf</a>, and I also recommend looking at Morten Frederiksen's FOAF at <a href=http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf>http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf</a> which supports far more profile information then my FOAF does.</p>

<p>Also useful is the IRC chat channel at irc.freenode.net #foaf -- I got a lot of useful tips and advice there.</p>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>I have now had CEOs of three different social networks send me emails asking me to compare Orkut to their service. I've not had a chance to dig deeply into good answers for each specific one, but I did have some general advice that I wanted to offer given my <a href=../../../2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html>recent experiences with Orkut.com</a>, and my <a href=../../../2003/12/evaluating_soci.html>evaluation</a> and <a href=../../../2003/12/followup_to_eva.html>followup</a> on various social networking services in December.</p>

<h4>Privacy</h4>
First, be extremely careful about privacy issues. For some of you outside the US, you may not know about what has been going on in the area of identity theft, but it has become a significant problem. I am not a privacy fanatic, but I am concerned that social networking services encourage people to reveal too much information too broadly, and that this will be someday be taken advantage of by identity thieves. For instance, many services ask for birthday and reveal it to everyone. You can ask for the birthday, but don't display it -- give the person's age, or birth month, but don't give the full info. I personally am particularly wary of billing address, billing zip code, birthday, and potential common security questions like name of pet, mother's maiden name, etc. These are in addition to the obvious targets of identity theft like SSN, full name, and account numbers.

<p>Orkut's interface for selectively allowing some fields to be visible "only to myself", "to friends", or to "friends of friends" is nice, but I wish it was for all fields. I also think every field by default should be set to "only to myself". In fact, all security parameters should default to reveal the least information, and have the tightest limits -- allow the user to open selectively.</p>

<p>If you are going to support all different kinds of social networks (dating, friendships, activities, business) consider finding ways to make sure that those people who are not using the service for dating are not asked for that info, and don't see it for others who are dating. People who are only using it for dating shouldn't see business info. If someone is using a service for all types of relationships, allow people to selectively set what they reveal to each group, say two columns of "only to connections who are dating" or "only to business connections".</p>

<p>Never reveal someone's email address or other critical information without them knowing about it. In particular there are issues with emails sent among members. The only safe way is to do redirection through your site (although that will cost you bandwidth.) But if you can't do that, then just tell people "your email will be revealed if you do this" -- that is enough.</p>

<p>Work hard on your TOS and Privacy terms. Don't let your lawyers rule you here too much -- find some way to get your principles out there and still cover yourself against problems. Make all the personal information that people give you be their information -- they are only leasing it to you temporarily.</p>

<p>Make it easy for someone to quit the system. Maybe offer to them to export their information in case they want to rejoin later, and give them an opportunity to send a last message to any connections they may have. Be friendly at all times, and as the market shakes out they may come back.</p>

<h4>Connections &amp; Invites</h4>
If possible, find some other way to call the connections between people "friends" -- maybe even use a unique trademarkable term. There is some power in the emotions behind the word friends that helps with the virus-like nature of social networking software, but I think in the long term it is a bad idea. LinkedIn and Spoke use the word connections which sounds too mechanical, but I think it is better then "friends".

<p>Don't encourage the "how many friends do my friends have" game. It sets up bad behaviors, and as you grow you don't want to have barriers of entry to new people who feel that they can't compete in that game. This means don't sort friends or groups etc. by the number of friends they have by default -- it can be an option, but just not be default.</p>

<p>Don't encourage people to by default upload their address book. Have that feature be off of some optional utility page. Have the default option for it to just scan for people that are already members of your system and to forget the rest -- that is effectively what I do with systems that ask for address book information, and they make it hard for me to do so. Don't store people's address information for them unless you can sync them with people's personal contact books -- save that for version 2.0, not 1.0 beta.</p>

<p>Don't focus on people contacting new people that are not already their connections. It is not the number of connections, but the quality. Instead, focus on helping people with their weak connections. It is 'reconnection' that is the most powerful feature of these social network services, not new connections. You can also help with "triage" -- how do I maximize the value of my existing weak connections with the least effort?</p>

<p>Allow people to opt-out with a custom message. What this means is that if someone sends an email to someone who has opted out, they will get something like. "Thanks for inviting me to Orkut -- I've decided for now not to join, but you can find me on Tribe." However, keep a list of people who have tried to connect to that opted-out user, and if that user does change their mind later, it will make it easier for them to have an initial list of friends that may already be on the service. Yes, I know that this risks sending people to other services, but there are so many now that you can get good buzz by doing the right thing, and recovering those people later when they have confidence in you.</p>

<p>You need to have better methods of handling invites from unknowns without saying no. For instance "I'm not sure I know you, have I forgotten?"</p>

<p>Related, don't fill out default text for invitations and other request forms -- force people to put something personal into the request, don't allow it to be blank. Never do what Orkut does and not give the opportunity to offer text when you invite someone who is already on the system.</p>

<p>Avoid anything beyond friends of friends as a primary part of your service. It bugs me that I see by default 3 degrees away in many services -- 2 degrees should be max by default, as that is the level that real referral can work. 3 degrees is too far for users to trust (though it can be optional for some purposes, or useful internally.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=6080f857- 4784-4679-8e41-c6881ed933ce">Friendship Circle</a> may also be a good idea, though perhaps how you classify people should be private. You may mark someone as being "family" "intimate" or "acquaintance" or "business", or whatever, however, no one else should see that; they should just see "connection" unless they have named you, and you in turn should not say that.</p>

<h4>Profiles</h4>
Find some better way then simple lists to do profiles. Someone's profile needs to express the richness of who they are -- it also needs to change and grow and flow over time, so make it easy for people to annotate and grow over time. Consider asking for only a few things at first, not make the process of filling out the profile feel daunting, then after each login prompt them to add one small thing that is useful based on how they used the service recently. For instance "You have joined the AnyoneButBush2004 group -- do you want to enter information to share with others about your political interests?".

<p>Right now lots of people are experimenting on their blog sidebars how best to profile themselves -- learn from them. Look at hundreds of examples, look for patterns beyond the obvious.</p>

<p>Allow people to have multiple affiliations, whether they be work or play. I'm a bad edge case personally, with too many hats to name, but almost everyone I know has at least two professional hats "Sysadmin by day, Writer by night", "Laywer on weekdays, Carpenter on weekends" , as well as several affiliation hats "Bay Area Costumer Guild president, member of League of Women Voters", etc.</p>

<p>Right now LinkedIn has the best looking professional profile, but it is still hard for some people to use. I like LinkedIn's use of multiple professional affiliations, however, I wish I could mark some as major or minor; for instance, there is a big difference between being an Advisor to MG Taylor and being CEO of Consensus. It also doesn't handle professional associations and lesser affiliations, much less non-professional affiliations and interests. Also, being able to arbitrarily order them would be nice, LinkedIn does it by date which can make for some confusing emphasis.</p>

<h4>Reputation &amp; Endorsements</h4>
Be very careful of the design of rating systems and reputation systems. They are extremely difficult to design well, as they too often can be gamed, or fall into reciprocity such that they are meaningless. My personal advice is just don't do it at first -- save it for a 2.0 version of the product, not 1.0 beta. If you are going to do it now, really study it -- there is a lot of good academic research on issues of reputation. It can be hard to slog through but it is worth it. Offer a grant to Danah's school for them to do research for you on the topic.

<p>Endorsements are a best way of doing reputation for now. They is also is imperfect and vulnerable to reciprocity games, however, as least you can see if two people are playing that game just by looking at the endorser and endorsee. If you find too much reciprocity you can basically ignore both players.</p>

<p>Allow endorsements at a more granular level. For instance, if you are offering dating and professional information, segregate the endorsements. Even more ideally, do like LinkedIn and allow endorsements of relatively small things in a profile, for instance "I really enjoy Chris' blog" against the blog profile item, and "I like what Chris says about the environment" against my affiliation with a group. Consider allowing endorsements of groups: "Of the three groups here on Wiki, I find this one fits me the best".</p>

<p>If you can afford it, consider hiring a game designer from the online game industry who understands behavior incentives in online games. If you can't, study it. Part of the reason why EverQuest is the largest MMPORG is because it incentivizes certain kinds of social behaviors. In fact, it could be considered to be a type of social network service.</p>

<h4>Launch &amp; Support</h4>
Be careful with your beta launch -- a culture for a community forms in the first few weeks, and our experience from online games is that the nature of this culture can make or break a project. Find ways to encourage the kinds of behaviors you want, and discourage those that you don't.

<p>Be very careful of labeling people who are gaming your product in ways you don't like. Being in Orkut's 'jail' is almost becoming a badge of honor. There is no reason why people who invite too many friends to join, submit too many posts to forums, or sends too many messages to friends of friends, should be put under the same label as those people who put child pornography up on your system and thus you've banned them. Instead, slow down the overly active people, just say in advance "If you invite this number of people, you may not invite more people for 24 hours, do you want to continue?", or "If you invite this person, you must wait an hour before inviting another.", etc. Also, if you do lock people out of a feature, don't lock them out of all features, just the one that they are over-using. If someone gets locked out of lots of features at the same time, then they should be looked at for possibly banning, but not if they are doing just one thing -- you want to encourage their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Make sure you give feedback to anyone that tries to be helpful, for instance in reporting a bug. Ideally public reports should be encouraged public (as this encourages other people to be helpful) but even private reports should be encouraged, and as promptly as possible including "Thanks for taking time to write up this, we are logged this problem and hope to get to it as soon as we can given limited resources." Find other ways to give feedback, such as a weekly report, or a group developers blog.</p>

<p>Create multiple stages for your beta, for instance "profile features beta", "group features beta", "scaling beta", "load beta", etc. Tell people in your beta what you want to hear about and not hear at each stage. As each stage ends, find some way to publically thank those who made the biggest difference.</p>

<p>Set up a bug tracking system like TypePad has (like Bugzilla but hugely simpler to use). From help menu at the top you can click to post a new report, see all open reports, or see all closed reports. Every help page can have at the bottom to open a report on that topic. If anything goes wrong there (404, various system error messages, etc) you should give you an opportunity to open a report. </p>

<h4>Features</h4>
Figure out how to use RSS everywhere for input and output -- if Orkut or Tribe's group features supported RSS feeds, they could be very powerful competition to the hugely funded Friendster. Figure out how to use trackbacks with your system, and make them simpler for users. Make group bookmarks and other lists available as OPML. I'm not a huge fan of FOAF yet, but figure out how to use it anyhow (and maybe vCards) until something better comes along, if nothing else but allow someone to import it and export it.

<p>My personal take is that if you can combine a substantial number of these <br>
features, you could have a great product that gives the others a run for the <br>
money:<br>
<ul><li>Offering intentional groups (like Tribe and Orkut) is essential. It is Friendster's and LinkedIn's weakest link.</li><br>
<li>eVite/Meetup style invitations for both private functions (come to my birthday party), friend functions (anyone near 00301 want to have lunch Thursday?) and groups (Let's all meet for dinner next week to discuss this).</li><br>
<li>Ability to import via RSS the recent items from my blog to my profile page</li><br>
<li>Optional blogging-style home pages (FunChain &amp; Live Journal) for those who don't already have blogs</li><br>
<li>Extended family support as an explicit type of group, grandmother, mother, child in college<br>
<li>Couples can be a form of a group also</li><br>
<li>Better ways to organize groups of groups</li><br>
<li>Better support for user-optional presence "There are members of this group who are reading it right now who have said that they are available online to members to this group, 3 via Skype, 12 via AIM"</li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=94333937-ecd8-4d08-994d-7f4c96c523dd">Permachat</a> at a group level is an interesting idea. I hate that I can't see chat text before the point I logged in</li><br>
<li>Lots of group management support, for instance:<br>
<ul><li>ability to have multiple admins (eGroups, Live Journal)</li><br>
<li>Group moderation (Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Advogato, etc.)</li><br>
<li>Optional group shared links (eGroups)</li><br>
<li>Optional group shared calendar (eGroups)</li><br>
<li>Polling inside groups (no one that I know of)</li><br>
<li>Invitation or approval of entry by different methods, such as by vote, by 1 reference from existing member, etc. (none that I know of)</li><br>
<li>Ability to merge groups (none that I know of) </ul><li>Wiki-style areas available for groups (no one that I know of)</li><br>
<li>Combine all the above with good innovative RSS and optionally Atom (FunChain, SocialText)</li><br>
<li>Supports the various blog submission APIs for blogs, wiki, and groups (none that I know of)<br>
<li>Do a great job for those who don't use RSS and those APIs to use email instead, including email submission (you can mail pages to a SocialText wiki)</li><br>
<li>Ability to be federated, i.e. I could still use my existing blog (you just mirror it), RSS aggregation, my FOAF file could be synced, you sync with my addressbook at Yahoo, etc.</li><br>
</ul><p></p>

<h4>Business Models</h4>
Business models for social networking services is going to be one of the biggest issues. Even those social networking sites with lots of money behind them are going to have difficulty because there are so many.

<p>The paid subscriber model is probably dead until some of the VC funded startups go out of business. Advertising can be a good model, but be careful not to make it obtrusive -- remember, Google has made good money with very simple ads.</p>

<p>If you don't have VC funding, find ways to co-opt partners -- build from the beginning support for Google AdSense and Adwords, Amazon APIs, etc. If you are small, consider federating with another company. Figure out what you can do to differentiate yourself from both your competitors and partners.</p>

<p>Don't be evil.</p>

<h4>Me</h4>
I am interested in getting more professionally involved with social software. I think we are still in Apple II days of social software -- we see the promise of things to come, but we are still typing in ALL CAPS. Given the overfunding in this field, my own ability to start a company as an <a href=http://www.alacrityventures.com>angel investor</a> is insufficient, so I'm looking to partner with others. I've been involved with online communities, groupware, collaboration, and security for over 20 years. If you are interested in an executive in this area, see my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">profile on LinkedIn</a>.

                                <p>I've not just been spending time looking at social networking services, I've also been digging deeper into wiki. I've still got more to go, but some of these will be of interest to you if you are considering implementing a wiki for your community, or if you are a wiki developer.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.zwiki.org>Zwiki</a> is based on Zope, and thus has a very interesting feature set. One of the more popular features is the topic mappings that it creates. When combined with the CMS features of Plone, it becomes even more interesting -- one of the best Zwiki/Plone communities to look at as an example is <a href=http://doc.hydrogenaudio.org/wikis/hydrogenaudio/FrontPage>Hurricane Audio</a>. Unfortunately Zwiki only works on the Zope web platform, which is not as popular as Apache.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.flexwiki.com>FlexWiki</a> is a very innovative wiki that is being developed by some Microsoft engineers and is ASP.NET based for Windows. I in particular like the <a href=http://flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.ExamplePropertyPage>property page features</a> which are an elegant way to handle meta-data, and also how it handles diffs.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.projectforum.com>ProjectForum</a> and <a href=http://www.courseforum.com>courseforum</a> are both fairly simple but elegant commercially supported wiki. Of particular note is that both are very easy to install, even on a Windows 2000 system or Macintosh, as well as on Linux. I was able to get a test ProjectForum up on my Windows PC in about 5 minutes, including downloading. It also has some nice "skins" available. I also like how private areas are created for each -- this is the basic difference between the two products, and a rare wiki feature.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/>WikidPad</a> is interesting because it is not a public service, but a shareware single-user "notepad" for Windows that supports wiki-style TextFormattingRules and WikiWords. If you have been using wiki a lot like I have, sometimes you catch yourself using wiki-style text everywhere, and I guess this product is for people who do that like me.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.socialtext.com>SocialText</a> is another commercially supported wiki, but is sold as a service not a product. They are very carefully added features while keeping things elegant and simple for less sophisticated business customers. They also host a number of public wikis, so if you want to see the current feature set see <a href=http://http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest>RSS-Winterfest</a> which also shows off their newest RSS support.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.seedwiki.com>SeedWiki</a> is another wiki service rather then product (sometimes called a WikiFarm), and is interesting because it doesn't use Wiki style TextFormattingRules -- instead, it has several WYSIWYG editors that allow you to directly edit the underlying HTML. This gives a huge amount of flexibility for some of the communities that use it, such as <a href="http://www.seedwiki.com/page.cfm?doc=WikiFish&amp;wikiid=1231">WikiFish</a>.</p>

<p>I also have heard good things about PHPWiki and MoinMoin, but I haven't had a chance to dig into those very much yet.</p>

<p>I personally have been using <a href=http://www.twiki.org>TWiki</a> for 4+ years at several of my businesses. Its strength is that it is oriented toward allowing private groups who can manage their own access privileges. It also has one of the most active 'plugins' developer areas with lots of ways to modify your TWiki to do different things (one of the plugins I'm investigating now is <a href="//http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/EvEm>EvEm</a>). My only complaints are that TWiki is rather hard to install, and that the default skin isn't very elegant (I recommend the <a href=">GnuSkin</a>, but read the docs very carefully as you have to chmod a module if you install it.)</p>

<p>Although it uses a fairly primitive wiki, I highly recommend the <a href=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki>Meatball Wiki</a> site for people very interested in wikis. It is a meta-wiki discussion community. It has some great pages on the life-cycle of wikis, on various design patterns and features of wikis, and of various other consequences of the medium. If you look at <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?back=CategoryWikiEngine">CategoryWikiEngine</a> it has one of the more complete lists of Wiki engines out there.</p>

<p>I will be reporting more on various wikis and wiki technology that I discover in the upcoming weeks.</p>

					<h3 class=entry-header><a href=../../../2004/02/confirmed_email.html>Confirmed Email Privacy Hole at Orkut</a></h3>
		



		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>Another Orkut user and I have confirmed a privacy hole in Orkut whenever you send a message to someone via Orkut.</p>

<p>For instance, whenever I send a message to anyone in the system that is forwarded by email, in the message headers it will read:</p>

<blockquote><pre>From: "Christopher Allen" &lt;member@orkut.com&gt;
Reply-To: "Christopher Allen" &lt;christophera@alacritymanagement.com&gt;;</pre></blockquote>

<p>When someone reads the message in their email software, the "From:" line will be my name but the fake email of &lt;member@orkut.com&gt; -- however, when you reply to it, it will use my real email address. This appears to happen whether or not I have my privacy settings to reveal my email address. For instance, I can set it so that no one (not friends, not friends of friends, only myself) can see my email address, but the address will still be revealed when I send an email</p>

<p>I had reported what I thought was a security flaw when you emailed to "friends of friends" a couple of days ago, but I was mistaken, as I reported in my blog <a href=../../../2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html>Insecurity at Orkut</a>.  However, as I didn't want risk "crying wolf" this time, so my friend and I triple checked this and have confirmed this privacy flaw.</p>

<p><s>They only way that I know of to avoid this is in your prefences to set that all of your messages should be sent to you via the web, not email.</s> [Updated: I was wrong, there is no way currently to avoid this other then not using an email address you care about.]</p>

<p>There are some that will say that this is a feature, i.e. when using email "what good is communicating with someone if there is no chance of a response" -- my answer to this is that an expectation has been set that email addresses can remain private, and if this is to be a feature, then users should be warned before sending an email "Your email address user@domain will be revealed when you send this." More ideally, like other social networking services, the "Reply-to:" should be to a special email address at Orkut that will do the lookup and forward appropriately.</p>

<p>One of the essential problems that Orkut needs to fix very soon is how to report problems like these, and if you are trying to help how to know that these problems exist. I want my criticism to be constructive, but it is very hard when you have no idea what is the best way to offer feedback. I've had many people reply to me in my blog and via email that they feel the same way.</p>

<p>For instance, right now there are 6 Orkut groups about Orkut:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=617">What Should Orkut Do?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=2026">Flaws in Orkut</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=3982">Orkut</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=1289">Orkut Design</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=781">Orkut: Tips, Feedback, ?'s</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=4556">Orkut Members</a></ul>

<p>Which groups should I post this problem to? Which will will be read by the Orkut staff?</p>

<p>As I've said in another of my blog postings <a href=../../../2004/02/followup_on_ork.html>Followup on Orkut</a>: <blockquote>Part of the problem is that even though Orkut is in beta, there is no organized feedback system. For instance they could offer a forum read by the developers, or even better a bug/issues tracking system like TypePad has, or Bugzilla.<p></p>

<p>In addition, feedback is a two-way street -- they could do a lot by offering a developers daily blog, or some type of regular announcement of what feature they wanted beta testers to test that day, or even acknowledgement "we already know that is an issue". Also, they need to show respect for good feedback publicly, as that will encourage more good feedback.</p>

<p>None of this is happening at this time, which means that people get frustrated, which also makes it easy rumors and conspiracy to spread. I want to be a constructive critic, but Orkut makes it hard for me to be so.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>For now, I recommend that these type of bug reports go into <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=6048">Orkut Beta</a>. Why not in "Flaws in Orkut" or in one of the other groups? Because I feel that focusing on 'Flaws' is too strongly negative, and none of the others quite fit. I've been a software developer -- everything is a compromise and good design is hard. By staying on the topics of current features, feature requests, bugs, suggestions, and by encouraging constructive critism and a balance of both positive and negative feedback, this group will be the best community for us to help Orkut until they offer us better alternatives.<br>

		<div class=entry-content>
                <input type=hidden name=zemanta-related val="">

                        <div class=entry-body>
                                <p>Like many others, I've been paying attention to <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a> in the last couple of weeks. I've answered more requests to be "friends" on Orkut then I have of any of the other half-dozen Social Networking Services I've tried, and I've looking at other people's friends to see if I know anyone. I've yet to ask someone to join Orkut that wasn't already a member, and I've been careful to not have anyone as a "friend" that I didn't know reasonably well and I thought knew me. Currently I have 68 Orkut "friends", many more then I have on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn</a>, which I've been using for several months and have 50 "connections".</p>

<p>In addition to this activity on Orkut, I've been reading a lot of blogs about other people's experiences on Orkut. In particular, I've found Danah Boyd's blog <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/>Apophenia</a> a great source for thought on social networking services, so I've got it near the top of my RSS aggregator. I'd just read her rant <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/venting_my_contempt_for_orkut.html>venting my contempt for Orkut</a> when I saw a follow up post <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.html>orkut pissyness round 2</a> where I read:<blockquote><p>Wanna see a big phat privacy hole on Orkut? Go to messages. Click compose. Click "friends and friends of friends." Click next. Copy &amp; paste all of your friends and their friends' email addresses.</blockquote><p>I tested this out, and discovered she was correct, when I clicked "friends of friends" I got a long web page of names and email address. So I sent to this list I'd generated:</p>
<blockquote><p>A serious security hole? Yep.

</p>

<p>I just was shown 1137 friend and friends of friends email address, including your email address. As reported by Zephoria:</p>

<p>http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.htm</blockquote><p>I got a lot of replies back like "What did you expect?" and "That is why I don't use my main email for Orkut".

</p>

<p>I also got a reply from Orkut Buyukkokten via email:<br>
<blockquote><p>Could you please send an email to your friends and friends of friends to tell them that there is no security hole?

</p>

<p>We worked very hard to ensure that the privacy of our members is not compromised in any way. I don't want our members to get the wrong impression.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreaciate it if you could pass the following message to you friends (:</p>

<p>You'll only see the e-mail addresses of people who chose to share them with you: if you mark your email address as not to be shared with friends and friends of friends, they won't be able to get your address this way. If you look at the list of people it's addressed to, you'll see that some are listed without addresses (unless you've got very permissive friends).</blockquote>

<p>Somewhat abashed, I checked, and since the last time I'd sent an email, the interface changed. I discovered that only 356 of 1137 of my friends of friends were actually allowing their email to be shown, and the rest now showed a "lock" icon next to their name. Of course, the first 100 or so on that list coincidentally allowed their emails to be shown, so I had assumed incorrectly that all had.</p>

<p>So I sent Orkut's reply out to my "friends of friends" and added links to my blog and this comment:<br>
<blockquote><p>I'm still quite uncomfortable with privacy issues of Orkut.com at this time. I've had to reveal more information then I'm comfortable, and the software is too lax in letting me see other people's info, for instance "relationship status" when I've marked myself as not interested in that. Maybe Orkut is just trying to be too much.</blockquote><p>I sent an email back to Orkut saying that I'd sent this email, then continued to get a lot of replies to my original email, and I discovered that I was now in Orkut "jail". This meant that I could not send messages, could not add friends or groups, etc. No reason was given for why I was in jail. The only reason why I'd seen <a href=http://blogs.it/0100198/2004/01/29.html#a2216>other people in jail</a> was because they had added too many friends too fast. I had only 50+ friends at the time, so I knew that wasn't the reason. I could only assume the worse.

</p>

<p>I'm out of Orkut "jail" this morning, but I still don't have any explanation of why. I continued to get replies both in support of my concerns:<br>
<blockquote><p>I tend to agree with you. I've learned more information than I expected about people. Also it's been a little odd to see people I know professionally on orkut, since I first conceptualized it as a social-friends service. (Then again, I've found professors on Friendster, which is much more explicitly social, so perhaps I'd better just accept that these people have lives.)

</p>

<p>At the same time, I think that Orkut's attempt to be all things to all people has helped it take off. I feel easier asking professional contacts to join orkut than I would for Friendster. It seems like less of a big deal to add someone to your orkut list rather than on another more focused service, as there is a level of plausible deniability as to intention. </blockquote><p>As well as comments like:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't want to be too harsh, but if perhaps you, and Danah, and Cory don't want to play then really no one is forcing you to play. But whining about things that you don't like is just, well, unseemly.</blockquote><p>I took a break to think on why I responded so negatively when Orkut has the appearance of doing something wrong (first, the 'security hole' that was a feature, and secondly the 'jail'). Then it came to me:

</p>

<p><strong><em>I'm insecure about orkut.</em></strong></p>

<p>Some of the definitions of 'insecure' are <em>not firm or firmly fixed; likely to fail or give way; lacking self-confidence or assurance; not safe from attack; lacking in security or safety; not financially safe or secure;</em>. The one that fits me the best is "lacking self-confidence or assurance". Why do I feel this way about Orkut?</p>

<p>I guess my insecurity started out at the very beginning. As it is in beta, you can't join Orkut, you have to be invited. This made the place seem 'exclusive' and thus possibly safer. Yet right off it asks you some fairly personal questions: What is your relationship style? What is your sexual orientation? Who are you living with? What are your politics?</p>

<p>Later I find out by looking at other people's information that this is all completely public. It isn't limited to just friends, or friends of friends, but instead is prominent. In fact, other then your name and how many "friends" you have, your relationship style is the most prominent thing listed. Do I really want to know that my business acquaintance that I see only at technical conferences 2 or 3 times a year is in an open marriage? Or divorced? Or gay?</p>

<p>I live in the Bay Area and I've seen it all, and consider myself open and try to be consciously non-prejudiced. That's not to say that I'm comfortable when I'm hit on by another man, but for that matter, I'm not that comfortable when I'm hit on by a woman. The point is that I don't think about someone's sexual and personal choices when I interact with them. I don't care if you are gay, into S&amp;M, or any other radical lifestyle. I don't care if your straight, chaste, and christian. What I do care about is your relationship to me -- if you feel that it is important to your identity to let me know, well that is between us. But I'm not going to pry. I once had a male employee in my office that wore a dress to work -- I still don't know if he is gay or not. It didn't matter to me and he didn't tell me -- what mattered was that he was good employee.</p>

<p>This started my 'insecurity' about Orkut. Later I read that you couldn't delete your pictures or profiles. This worried me. Then I read that the system was down because of a XML hack.</p>

<p>When Orkut came back after the hack, a new feature was added, fans and ratings. This made me yet even more uncomfortable. Did I really want to have to not say I was a fan of someone that said they were a fan of me? Wasn't endorsing someone a far better signifier of fan? What does Trustworthy mean? Cool? I refused to enter anything for Sexy. I worried if someone could see my ratings, or reverse socially engineer it, or hack it.</p>

<p>Thus these insecurities of mine led me to think the worst and to post too quickly about the "Friends of Friends Security Hole" and still feel uncomfortable about why I was put in "jail".</p>

<p>So far I've had no abuses of me by Orkut -- I've had only two people ask me to be friends that I don't know, and so far I've not been told that someone is my fan whom I'm not willing to honestly say that I'm a fan back. I've even found some old friends that I'd lost track of, which is exactly why I still "play" and not leave Orkut. I do believe that there may be something useful in these social network services.</p>

<p>Yet I feel that my old blog entry <a href=../../../2003/12/evaluating_soci.html>Evaluating Social Network Services</a> that concluded with my take on <strong>The Perfect Social Network Service</strong> is still quite on track:<br>
<blockquote><p>My ideal service would have the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affiliations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryze, but less clunky.</blockquote>

<p>I'd add to that list that I'd like to have more control over my information, in particular, relationship information. That I'd like to see more "progressive disclosure" where there was more granularity of what was revealed at public, friends of friends, friends, fans, fans who I've endorsed, etc. Finally, I'd really not like to see things that are not applicable to me, such as relationship information of other people when I'm not looking for relationships, or professional information of others if I'm only using Orkut for dating.</p>

<p>[Update: another Orkut user and I found a different privacy hole when sending emails -- see <a href=../../../2004/02/confirmed_email.html>Confirmed Email Privacy Hole at Orkut</a>.]</p>

                                <p>In the last few weeks I've gotten more invitations to friends via <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a> then I have from all the other social networks I've tried out.

In <a href=http://www.ryze.com/go/ChristopherA>Ryze</a> I have 36, and in <a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.Net</a> I have 32, and in my oldest FriendlyFavors, I have 5.</p>

<p>One good thing has come out of Orkut, I've found email addresses for some old friends that I thought I'd lost. Yet I am very frustrated by Orkut -- it made some minor user-interface improvements over some of the others, but fundamentally misses the boat. My biggest problem with Orkut is that it reveals far too much information -- do I really want to know that business associate Y is in an open marriage, or that X is gay and single? But that in some ways is minor problem -- the problem is that it appeals the "friend counter" evil angel on our shoulder, not to the "help me be a better member of my community" good angel.</p>

<p>Judith Meskill of <a href=http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/>The Social Software Weblog</a> asks <a href=http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/6832739961761474/>How Many Social Nets Are Too Many?</a>:<br>
<blockquote>by my count, there are more than 100 social networking services that I have been observing — cruising past my virtual radar gun — in the past few months. I have been tracking this burgeoning growth of services aspiring to help discover and connect my friends, potential partners, business cohorts, and various levels of acquaintances — and I have this scary feeling that I am only carving shavings off of the tip of an iceberg with this list.<p>(snip)<p><p><a href=http://www.affinityengines.com/ title="Affinity Engines">Affinity Engines</a>, <a

<p>Leander Kahney writes in Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62070,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3" title="Wired News: Social Nets Not Making Friends">Social Nets Not Making Friends</a>:<br>
<blockquote>Perhaps it was inevitable. A backlash is under way against social networking services like Friendster, as more and more companies crowd to join the latest hot Internet trend. Sick of invitations to join networking services, and the constant nagging to validate friends or acquaintances, some people are turning against the ever-growing social networking services.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Danah Boyd rants about Orkut in <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/venting_my_contempt_for_orkut.html>Venting My Contempt for Orkut</a> and uncovers a <a href=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.html>security hole</a> in it as well.</p>

<p>Right now only LinkedIn comes halfway to my expectations, and still has a long way to go. I still stand by my post of a month-and-a-half ago <a href=../../../2003/12/evaluating_soci.html>Evaluating Social Network Services</a><br>
<blockquote>The Perfect Social Networking Service: My ideal service would have the the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affilations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryse, but less clunky. </blockquote><p></p>

<p>With so many others out there, they may all fail, and the good ideas that are hiding behind the bad will not survive.<br>
