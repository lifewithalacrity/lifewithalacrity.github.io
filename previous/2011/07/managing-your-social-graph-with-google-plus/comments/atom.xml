	<title>Comments on Managing your Social Graph with Google+ [Google Plus]</title>
	<subtitle>With Google+ almost two weeks into its test phase, conversation about this new social network service seems to be going in circles. Literally. That’s because Circles is the Google+ feature that users are generating the most buzz about. It’s Google’s answer to the problem of organizing your social graph online. If you’re not familiar with a social graph it’s a map of everyone you know and how they are related to you. Social graphs are tricky; as you try to define them you’ll inevitably run into some complications. [Post continues with more advice on managing Google+, your social graph, privacy, and time management tips.]</subtitle>

How, however, do you manage to add people to them, when you have quite so many (looking at the second list with the 1.3 etc) - I can only see 1.5 rows of circles! (OK, I know you can add someone by right clicking &amp;amp; going for the add to circle, but that&amp;#39;s fiddly if you&amp;#39;re block adding them!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also got in the (equivalent of the) me circle my &amp;#39;other&amp;#39; G+ account, that I&amp;#39;ve been using to see the effect of things like extended circles. Which I do find useful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would be nice, if, at some point, rather than having &amp;#39;stream&amp;#39; it was possible to see in a single stream all the updates from a set of circles, rather than 1 or all. (Unless that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve yet to find!) &lt;br /&gt;
(That, and I want boolean logic for them, so I can have everyone who is in both a &amp;amp; b, but not a or b!) &lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2011/07/managing-your-social-graph-with-google-plus.html">&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea of using circles for social time management. One big problem I have with networks is that I feel committed (obligated?) to a certain, indistinct, level of communication - particularly with those people that social media has now kept me in &amp;#39;contact&amp;#39; with, and whom in the old days I would have lost touch with. The end result is always a big time defecit and multiple layers of guilt. The idea of being able to apply some kind of equitable rationing/priority to circles may be a bit geeky... but it&amp;#39;s preferable to non-specific angst  ;0)&lt;/p&gt;</content>
