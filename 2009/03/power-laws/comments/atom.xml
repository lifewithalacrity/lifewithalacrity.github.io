	<title>Comments on Community by the Numbers, Part III: Power Laws</title>
	<subtitle>In my first article in this series I talked about community numbers: how the sizes of groups ultimately affect their success (or failure). However what I discussed only offers up the most rudimentary explanation of the dynamics, and that is because typically not all of the members of a group are equally involved. In order to better define who constitutes the tightly-knit &quot;participant community&quot; upon which the group thresholds act, we have to study power laws which let us measure the intensity of individuals&#39; involvement in a group. (post continues with more details)</subtitle>

&lt;p&gt;In the course of your experience have you seen much of a difference between the style of content produced in communities and how that impacts the power law?  A few years ago I started a project to create an open source methodology for information management http://www.openmethodology.org, which worked in concert with corporate solutions also built in a collaborative fashion.  At least in this case, we have found the power law threshold to be even higher when creating a more structured, method-based approach to collaboration.  We did feel there was a need to put some controls in place for an &amp;quot;open method&amp;quot; and have experimented with different ways to build a collaborative commmunity.  Some good progress has been made, but its been tough going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also applied this same approach to sustainability http://www.open-sustainability.org.  Once again, very hard work to build the community but some slow steps are being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any thoughts around more structured collaboration and how it can negatively impact community growth in readership and contributions?  Any recommendations on ways to improve it?&lt;br /&gt;

I seemed to have kept only the most dedicated readers (1%) from just simply joining a local group.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
