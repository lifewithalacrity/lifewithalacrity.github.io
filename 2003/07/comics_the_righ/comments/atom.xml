			<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/07/comics_the_righ.html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very interested in the idea of micropayments ($1 to $2) to sell &amp;quot;printable&amp;quot; versions of my how-to articles from my Web site. I realize that it needs to be quick and painless for people to bother paying for this content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve discovered the micropayment secret rates for Paypal (2.9% + 5Â¢, I think) and it works for me. But I really wish BitPass were still in business. It would automatically give access to the downloadable files. Instead, I&amp;#39;ve had to create a convoluted rule-based system in my e-mail app to send the download link when payment is received. Not only is this insecure, but it requires that my e-mail application be up and running to process the requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any additional information about this topic that you can point me to? I think micropayments are a good model for electronic publishing. The fee is low enough for anyone to afford, and those with a conscience will be more likely to pay than to pirate. Would love to see what you think after all these years have gone by.
